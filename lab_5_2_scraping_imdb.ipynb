I am a big fan of the first movie and I think where this one falls apart for me is that it focuses too much on current events (that the movie will probably be irrelevant in a few years); focuses way too much on politics and on the plot with Borat's daughter. Many people are praising her performance here. I think she's fine; but I don't think the script is anything special here and it doesn't help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself; but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original.\",\n",

       " \"Borat A subsequent movie film\\n2020\\n15\\nDirector: Jason Woliner\\nStarring: Sacha Baron Cohen; Maria Bakalova etcOverall rating 91/100Borat the subsequent moviefilm sees the return of Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) who must return to America in order to sell his daughter to powerful American politicians but he grows a connection with her. Well what can I say Borat 2 was bonkers and insane; but mostly brilliant; clever and had a lot more heart than the first film; so let's get started.First of all the movie was very funny; had great comedic performances and chemistry as well as a fun set up. This movie was absolutely hilarious; even more outrageously funny than the first film; there was so many funny comedy skits; highlighting and cleverly taking the mick out of a lot of republicans and how they have handled many things; it's humour was even more clever; and due to everything that's going on right now gave even more comedic opportunities and satire for Borat to be involved with. The comedic performance from Sacha Baron Cohen was also as expected fantastic; he bought the character of Borat back to life perfectly with fantastic dialogue and his form of comedy and his comedic timing was excellent here; but also Maria Bakalova was fantastic here as well; she held her own with Sacha and in some places was even more funny than him; they both had excellent chemistry with each other and watching there relationship develop was great. The set up for the movie was also very fun; having the view of Kazakhstan being the complete opposite and Borat being forced out of the country set up the main plot point and new characters well; and was a creative way to develop the story.My only negative for the movie would be that they went slightly too far with some of the comedy. I did feel like the movie went slightly over the line with certain skits and costumes that felt more offensive than funny for me in places; the movie usually does a great job at being controversial but still able to get away with it; but I definitely think they went slightly too far in a couple of places.My final few positives would be the themes; links to real people; costumes and heartwarming moments. The movie had really great themes of really showing you how extreme and horrible a lot of Trump supporters opinions are and was a shocking but needed insight into the political divide in America; the links to real life people like Melania Trump or the random name drops and cameos for comedic effect were excellent and cleverly executed. The costume designs for Borat were also excellent and funny; due to the success of the first film Sacha was being recognised more by the public; so hats off to the costume team for providing very convincing and often hilarious costumes for Borat to wear. Finally the movie had a lot more heartwarming moments than the first film; the themes of women being capable of anything and that everyone is human and not so different was handled really well; with some genuinely kind and caring people involved within the film that was very sweet to watch.Overall Borat 2 a subsequent movie film; despite going slightly too far in places; is just as clever; outrageous and hilarious as the first film with a great new member of the cast and more heart than the first film.\",\n",
       " \"Amazing; Sacha remains a genius.Fantastic work.As with all his work it's amazing. He always uncovers such gross and frightening attitudes and opinions.\",\n",
       " 'One or two raunchy laughs. Nothing special. Cannot even be compared to first film. The movie is about 90 minutes long; and 75 of it is somewhat boring.',\n",
       " \"I'be been a fan of SBC since he was Ali G on UK TV. Back then his comedy was a breath of fresh air. The first Borat film was hilarious as was Grimsby. But this effort fell flat and the dull story couldn't be revived by the extreme vulgarity in the story. I don't think I laughed more than a couple of times. Final verdict: terrible.\",\n",
       " \"Borat and his 'daughter' are fantastic!\\nTears in my eyes.\\nWe need more of this in these times!\",\n",
       " \"Even it has loads of more or less light triggers I laughed way too often and I don't regret it at all! Loved the first movie and the whole idea behind a soft scripted movie with a lot of improvisations and also dancer for Sacha Baron Cohen and the crew! Amazing what he's doing just for make the audience laugh and tell his point of few.\\nWaiting for the next one ;)\",\n",
       " 'I thought it was way funnier than the first. Mr. Cohen is just so awesome and hilarious. The movie was funny all throughout. Would recommend.',\n",
       " 'The main appeal of part one was being able to observe the culture clash during the confrontations with real people out there in the wild. This one replaced all of that with cringe-worthy; Reality TV level fake BS. And the grand finale/scandal is clever editing and shameful practices at best; entrapment and defamation at worst. Most of the jokes and social commentary contained feel like someone rushed to harvest the lowest hanging fruit and turned them into an easily digested; yet nutritionally completely void sludge for the lowest common denominator audience. Strange to see from such a seemingly intelligent guy.',\n",

       " 'Subsequent Moviefilm follows the same basic premise as the first movie; Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as an outlandish character and travels across America pranking real American citizens; and revealing the true nature of normal people; from the good to the bad. This time however; instead of chasing after Pamela Anderson; Borat has his daughter with him; and hopes to marry her off to one of Trump\\'s political allies in order to earn a better reputation for glorious nation of Kazakhstan. This results in a much more interesting and engaging story; and gives us another character to get to know and really root for. Azamat; the producer in the first movie; was never given much attention as a character. He was just someone for Borat to feed off of. But Tutar is not treated the same way; and even has her own character arc and her own chances to prank people. Not to mention the twists and turns brought on by current events that were moulded into the story so effortlessly it\\'s hard to believe they started filming this last year before everything hit the fan. Not only is the pandemic slotted in so seamlessly; but it manages to elevate the movie - from a narrative standpoint - far above anything else Baron Cohen has done.Of course Borat is all about the pranks; and while the tighter narrative of the movie does make the whole affair feel a lot more scripted; it\\'s no less funnier for it (in fact it might debatably be funnier; but we\\'ll get there in a minute). Definite highlights include Tutar\\'s time with the Jeanise; the babysitter; who thought she was participating in a real documentary about teenage brides. What she puts up with from newcomer Maria Bakalova is astounding; and she comes across as the most effortlessly caring and wholesome person; doing what she can to change Tutar\\'s worldview. She\\'s also low-key hilarious by herself; such as her reaction to Tutar calling the Earth flat; or the way she points out that breast implants are not going to change much in Tutar\\'s life. Another entirely wholesome highlight is Borat\\'s 5-day stay with a couple of redneck guys who; while clearly misinformed themselves; do all they can to educate Borat. These are guys who think Coronavirus is fake; and avoid liberal people as much as they can; and yet they take a complete stranger into their home when he had nowhere to stay (at least to their knowledge); and offer assistance however they can. Baron Cohen dressed as Trump bursting in on a speech by Mike Pence; the constant back-and-forth with a poor postman and his fax machine; and the pair going to a pro-life health centre to remove a candy baby from Tutar are hilarious as well; while the Women\\'s Club and Debutante scenes are prime cuts of cringe and embarrassment.Between all of that and the more traditional comedy moments between Borat and Tutar; I would argue Subsequent Movefilm is a far funnier movie than the first Borat. The first had its moments for sure; but Subsequent Moviefilm is almost relentless with its jokes. It not only aims higher; but hits higher as well. The more obviously scripted nature of the film is bound to turn off some die-hard fans; but for me it meant the jokes were really worked on and refined in order to be as funny as they could possibly be. The best example of this is the Disney-parody of Melania Trump; and her first meeting with Trump; all in Disney-style cartoon. And then was the song Borat performs really written by the rednecks? I doubt it; it has Baron Cohen all over it. But that didn\\'t make his performance of it at the anti-mask rally any less hilarious to watch.\\nBut of course being a Borat movie; there\\'s more here than just the comedy. Beneath the jokes and pranks is more of a look at the highs and lows of American society. I\\'ve already mentioned how wholesome both the black babysitter and the rednecks were despite their political viewpoints; but it swings the other way as well. The pastor at the women\\'s health centre barely bats an eye at the implication that Borat impregnated his daughter; and in light of those revelations; still refuses Tutar\\'s right to an abortion. Not to mention the numerous occasions of unashamed creeps like the plastic surgeon who admits he would take advantage of Tutar was Borat not present; or Guiliani himself who did not come off in a particularly great light even before the moment of controversy. Then there\\'s the frightening situations of mob mentality Borat encounters; such as his prank on Mike Pence being met with the crowd chanting \"four more years\"; or his racist; misogynistic; and anti-Semitic song being welcomed and cheered on by a crowd of anti-maskers. Baron Cohen said himself that he was forced to wear a bulletproof vest on a couple of occasions; something he was never required to do for the first film.Some of this movie will not age well; most notably anything relating to coronavirus (which ended up being nearly half the movie); while other moments (again coronavirus related) have aged like a fine wine already. Baron Cohen appears so much more at home in the character of Borat than he ever was in the first movie; resulting in his pranks being so much more effective; as well his general acting making the whole affair a lot more convincing. Unfortunately for him; he discovered Maria Bakalova who is astonishing and gives it her all. There was not a single moment she wasted; and she committed one hundred percent to every gag and every prank; not only keeping up with Baron Cohen; but sometimes completely blowing him out of the water. Some people will hate the increased sense of script; while I feel the movie benefited greatly from it; and it\\'s still chock full of candid improv moments to keep it as Borat as always. I enjoyed this a lot more than the first movie; like it\\'s not even close. I could definitely see myself watching this again in the near future. I give it a very high 8/10 (so high I genuinely debated giving it a 9).',\n",
       " \"It's just bad; 98% it's all scripted and staged and the daughter's scenes are not funny.\\nThe old Borat would have epic non staged scenes and he would make fun of anyone; doesn't matter their political side; race or gender. In 2020 we would expect Borat to crash rallies; parades and cupcakes student councils. But nothing... Just staged unfunny stuff and same jokes all over again. Very disappointed. Just watch the old movies. This one is super boring.Basically he just played it safe. He's afraid to be canceled so he just went after people that don't go crazy on Twitter. Old Borat (and Bruno or Ali G) would never be afraid of being canceled.\",\n",
       " \"Don't get me wrong. I laughed myself silly quite a few times. But the tone of this sequel seemed off; and it took a while to realize the difference.In the original; Borat played such a complex; naive character; a true fish out of water. If you had encountered such a person in real life; you'd wholeheartedly want to help him. And that's where the original's hijinks started.Subtle character differences in this one; though. The seemingly sweet veneer was gone at times. Rather than having some more or less harmless fun with the unknowing participants; he struck a harsher mocking tone. Several scenes are rather cringeworthy. Some kind; decent people bent over backwards to help a guy in a bad spot; and caught nothing but crap for their efforts. I'd call that a big misfire; and it severely detracted from any desired comedic tone.\",\n",
       " \"This movie is extremely stupid and not funny at all; the first one was better. Don't waste your time\",\n",
       " \"The original film was superb but this sequel is predictable; poorly written and just plain boring. Let me just put out there now that I'm no fan of Trump and my opinion is by no means biased. However the film tries too hard to smear conservatives and it just ends up looking desperate and unfunny.\\nFurthermore the sense of deja vu is overwhelming as SBC recycled far too much from the original and it just does not work in 2020. Introducing a significantly new character is often a sign of desperation and the introduction of Borat's daughter Tutar is no exception. She's like Scrappy doo in Scooby doo or the sand snakes in Game of thrones. Tutar is another awful character but I understand why she was necessary as Borat is too well known in 2020 to trick people into an interview. It begs the question was this film necessary? I would say definitely not. For me it has soured the Borat character and taken some shine from the original film. SBC is a genius but I can only imagine that he was forced into making this film for political reasons.\",\n",

It is all just so his clique of liberal cosmopolitan elites can look down on Muslims and Christians. I will admit that Cohen is smart and capable of being funny; but; he is not as smart or funny as he thinks he is. I watched this with my family (who loved the first movie) and they did not laugh once during this film. It is all basically the same formula and really forced. I imagine this will get quite good reviews because he attacks Trump and most critics will love that; but; this is not a good movie.

So who the movie is aimed at is quite the mystery.The critics reviews are also perplexing as reading their reviews they talk about an average movie at best which gets good in the last half hour if you stick with it but its not as good as the first and yet they are still awarding it 4 or 4.5 star out of 5Its clear there is an agenda in the movie but it seems utterly lost in a what is a confusing movie. It shows a lot of shops selling things to Borat and his daughter and ignoring anything they say to make the sale; is that a dig at capitalism or just the greed of humanity?It shows a woman showing genuine concern for Borat's daughter and her proposed plastic surgery and her lack of understanding of her body.It shows the Russel family take in a foreigner during a national epidemic and tolerate his cultural differences; it also tries to highlight their 'southern prejudices' as they talk about Democrats drinking blood.It then shows Borat in disguise singing a song about injecting the virus and the crowd are singing along then the Russel family help to reunite Borat and his daughter.I wanted to turn the movie off after the first twenty minutes but having read the reviews I stuck with it to see the good last half hour but even then its just a slog.Honestly; the only shocking thing about this movie is the high reviews its been getting.\",\n",

The only people I found authentic are the doctor at the pro life clinic; the Trump supporters at the rally and all of them who got their faces blurred at the concert. ***SPOILERS**** Besides that the only authentic reaction from a person that I believe is Rudy Giuliani where Borat's daughter took advantage of Giuliani's kindness (and naivety) by pretending to be a journalist and having an interview with him. After the interview has concluded you can see Borat's daughter setting up Giuliani by pretending to help him remove the wires from his clothes. Then Borat rushes into the room saying to take him instead of his daughter insinuating that Giuliani is a creep who is willing to get in bed with an underage girl (at least to the audience with heavy and nearly perfect editing).Sure the movie is funny at times and had some good cringe worthy scenes in there. But it ain't enough to redeem it especially when there is a decisive motive behind it. Like one scene in the movies insinuates black trump supporters complementing trump on twitter of Facebook are fake and made by spammers from a third world country. Sure laughter brings people together but the laughter that Cohen provides is one that's only decisive and adds fuel to the fire.\",\n",

For me watching the movie from another country without any knowledge about America was a joyfull but frightening experience. Especially the scenes with Judith the jew. I heard that she passed away (may she rest in piece) and that her daughter actually sued Sacha for making the film and was demanding that they removed the scene with her from the movie. I understand that to 100% but still. Probably the most beautiful part of the movie that Judith actually accepted Borat for being a jerk; giving him a hug and saying the word \"hope\".I truly think this is a masterpiece in all ways. You can seperate the scenes from reality and still stay very close to the content of this film. What an absolute blast it was but I must admit; many of the scenes where very very very immature. Like the sequence at the prom/ball with all the daughter and fathers. I wish I could see the aftermath from that building but it skipped to the next part directly. It portayed America and the Donald Trump followers like complete idiots but still with balls of still managed to live among them and speak to them as they respected Borat.GREAT ACTING - VERY VERY FUNNY - SACHA EXPOSED EVIL TO THE TRUTH - MADE AMERICA LOOK STUPID AGAIN*CHENGUI Sacha; I sincerelly hope that I will meet you someday.^thank you???',\n",

The daughters reaction to her father offering a large sum of money in exchange for Borat's daughter was priceless; and the fact it was so genuine made it 10x funnier.\\nThe way the film ties in with current events but is also not constantly about covid is done extremely well and creates a great story line.\\nIn my opinion this film is just as hillairous as the original; but just at a less frequently; but is made up for with the better plot and conclusion.A special mention to the supporting actress who seems relatively unknown; but gave an exceptional performance.

       " \"Jagshemash! This mockumentary once again centers around Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev; a naïve misogynistic; racist; anti-Semitic stranger to American culture (Sacha Baron Cohen). While not as controversial shocking nor funny as the original. This Amazon Studios Video on Demand sequel directed by Jason Woliner deserved a high five for having more heart than the 2006 flick. While focusing on Borat's relationship with his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) on her arranged marriage to a top US politician can get annoying at times especially with the actress use of a heavy Bulgarian accent loud over nagging voice. I found the chemistry between them generally moving. Good acting. Both individuals do grow more likeable as the film goes on and into better people. It's so unlike the first movie where the individuals mostly stay the same. Nevertheless; I didn't like what the filmmakers did with original supporting characters like Azamat (Ken Davitian) & Luenell (Luenell Campbell). I get that the performers had pay disputes; but their characters should be written off the film a little better than what we got. Still the sequel does a good job acknowledges its predecessor's success as well as the gap between movies; by explaining in universe that the first film made Kazakhstan into a laughing stock in the national stage. Thus; the government punish Borat for over a decade until he was given another chance with this sequel. Nevertheless; the guerrilla prank style filmmaking kinda has wine down since 2006; as the character's image has become way too popular. Cohen even had to retired Borat at one time due to being unable to fool unaware real people to gain access to their genuine' s reactions toward solecism for laughs. In order to make the movie work; Sacha had to put Borat under heavy makeup and new disguises or give comedic trolling the crowd scenarios to Tutar. Because of that; there is very few scenes of Borat dress in his traditional suit and acting like himself; which is a shame. To add onto that; the people that he does interacted with; seem more in with the joke than the other movie. I'm not saying that they were paid performers; but I doubt that conspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell would allow a man with a filmmaking crew to stay with them for five whole days without noticing something odd during a pandemic. Bits like them going to find Tutar at a rally seem heavily rehearsed. The same can be said with Jeanise Jones who drives her to the clinic and gives a bizarre; but inspiriting semi long speech to Borat's daughter about womanhood. It's really hard to believe that these people didn't know that it was a work. The only confirm person that I can tell that was in with the joke was Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Her story was so charming that Cohen broke character. Sadly; the film's creators still got sued for fraud when her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that Judith did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness despite otherwise. Surprisingly unlike the first movie that result in many legal actions by participants ranging from individuals to whole cities. This one had little. Still; as of this writing; it is too early to tell. After all politicians like Rudy Giuliani might sued over allegations of impropriety. The actress did kinda led him on. Regardless the country of Kazakhstan will probably continue to hate their backwater racism portrayal in these films. Some Kazakhstanis really wanted this film to be canceled. I doubt that they would be happy with the twist ending involving the coronavirus. Still it makes me wonder what was the original climax if the pandemic never did hit during the production of this movie. I can see it being much more grandeur. COVID-19 really did good a number on the flick as the banning of large gatherings meant less events for Borat to crash into. While Cohen was indeed lucky to gain access to one of the Republicans key conferences. He didn't get the reaction that he was looking for with Donald Trump like he got with Ali G with the ice cream glove business skit. It's a shame that the scenes with Trump got cut from the final version. As for the sequence with Mike Pence. That interaction wasn't as impressed in real life. Unlike the film with the long pause; Pence just continue his speech as if they weren't any disruption. Cohen was quickly escort out of the building. Unlike the first Borat flick; in which the actor was famously arrested nearly 100 times and follow by the FBI. He felt that he risked his livable more making this movie due to the harsh political unrest that came with the pandemic. Cohen even said there were two separate occasions in which he had to wear a bulletproof vest. It's safe to say that the rightwing rally where Borat sang an offensive song was probably one of them. While that song was somewhat catchy. It was still disturbing to see some people cheer him on. It reminds me so much of the 'Peace' episode of the Da Ali G Show when Borat sang a similar tune. While I do like that Cohen mocked their echo chamber attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak for all it's worth. I just wished they didn't recycle the same types of the pranks that you can see on one of his old show. It made some of the sequences somewhat tiresome. Meanwhile others felt disconnected and uncompleted like the random barbershop gag. Regardless; the humor in this is probably better than what Cohen plan in the unauthorized sequel called 'My Brother' starring Borat's mentally-challenged brother Bilo. The cringe factor in that version would be too much to handle. Overall: Dziekuje Cohen for making the right decision. In the end; while the movie is not as good as the original. It's still worth skipping sexy time to check out. A must watch.\",\n",

She made every attempt in removing his sound equipment and coaxing him into the bedroom to make him look foolish and it failed. He was simply tucking in his pants.

Borat; once again; reminds us that once we stop caring about the societies overwhelming idiosyncrasies; we can all live in social harmony. Yes; i will admit some of the themes felt...forced.

       " \"You really have to wonder how this film came together; especially with some of the scenes at the end. Mind you; I guess they really did roll with the times quite well; because I suspect that as things changed dramatically around March 2020 they had to completely rework the script at the last minute; but then again CoVid really did take the world by surprised (not that we didn't see anything like this coming; it is just that we basically live in our own little bubbles; and don't expect things that happen on the other side of the world to really affect us all that much).Look; I've never been a particularly big fan of Cohen; and I wasn't a particularly big fan of his first film; but a part of me wanted to see this film; even if it was because I was captivated by the trailer. It turned out to actually be pretty good; and surprisingly I found myself bursting out in laughter numerous times during the film. However; the thing that I thought was great was how the film simply seemed to roll with the times; especially since halfway through we have Borat wandering around the empty streets wandering where everybody has gone (and ends up shacking up with some conservatives for five days).Actually; that scene was pretty cool; because while on one hand there is the suggestion that he was mocking their beliefs; he was also demonstrating to us that they are actually nice guys. The fact that they let this guy stay with them for five days; and didn't get upset despite some of the really weird things that he was doing; and even went as far as to point out that his book was wrong; really does go to show that these people aren't actually the monsters that some people make them out to be.Mind you; the end scene is an absolute classic; and as Cohen indicates; we really should make up our mind as to what was really going on. It was quite funny though that the person that the joke was a target of thought that he had out played Cohen; without actually realising what was actually going on. Of course; once the film was released you can imagine that this person has immediately gone into damage control.I guess one of the problems with a film like this is that you aren't going to get the real reactions that you would if it wasn't being recorded; though I understand that Cohen does get into these things by pretending to be somebody completely different. However; the rather deadpan faces that you get with some of the scenes; such as in the family planning clinic and in the hardware store; as well as in the store with the fax machine; does suggest that while it was odd; it was not something that was really going to raise concerns (which no doubt would have had a completely different result if; say; they were using hidden cameras in the clinic).I tell you what though; Maria Bakalova was absolutely outstanding in this film; and she just falls into the role so well. The other thing is the way that they use language - like; I have no idea what they are speaking; and it certainly sounds as if they are communicating with each other; despite the fact that Bakalova is speaking Bulgarian; and Cohen is speaking Hebrew Gibberish (I'm not even sure if that is actually a language). Yet; they do it so well; and it comes across so authentic; despite the fact that it is all a put on.Yeah; this is actually a pretty cool film; and I must say that I really did enjoy it; even though it does make you feel uncomfortable in parts. Personally; I wouldn't necessarily call it eye opening; and I doubt that it is going to change the election all that much; but it was still a pretty good watch. Oh; and I did quite like the bit at the beginning where he actually played up the fact that he can't really walk around dressed as Borat anymore.\",\n",

If it were; there would actually be execution's towards them. the first film was way more racist and sexist. while this movie focused on being pretty much just sexist material because race is a harder thing nowadays.

I must also acknowledge that many people have reviewed this quite low most likely because of political leanings; but even I; who consider myself more right leaning found this to be a completely transparent and truthful look at the sad state of America.Everyone has prime so I see no reason anyone shouldn't watch this.\",\n",

Borat: Subsquent Moviefilm simply doesn't manage to show us much that's worth remembering a week; a month; or a year from now (despite being linked to the election).

The Tutar character (Borat\\'s daughter) poses as a reporter to interview \"America\\'s Mayor\". She\\'s nervous; awestruck; flirtatious; and the old man just ate that up. He kept reaching across to touch her hands to \"reassure\" her. He has no problem being led into a bedroom by her and even lays back on the bed to adjust something in his pants. Zero funny about that.Unlike all the other uncomfortable moments in the film; this part just angered and nauseated me. It wasn\\'t rehearsed or fictional; and I guess that\\'s the point. That was the Real Rudy. A creepy and lecherous monster. A definite skin-crawling scene.Seems like Sacha Baron Cohen has matured. He wrote a much better film that mixes the fictional characters with the real people in a more effective way.

Some of it just wasn't all that funny to me; but it had plenty of laughs otherwise. All-in-all; it was entertaining and I watched it for free thanks to Amazon Prime.\\nBut wait -- there's more! I have to take issue with the way that the media; Cohen and the production company have portrayed Rudy Giuliani here. I admit that I was a Rudy fan when I lived in New York and was very impressed with the way he conducted himself on 9/11; but I think he's lost his mind with age and has become nothing short of a hand-puppet for the most (the hugist) imbecilic conspiracy theorist; McDonald Trump. That said; I felt manipulated by the footage of Rudy and had to rewind it several times to try to align what I saw with what I read in the press. CNN and the New York Times would have us believe that he was caught making sexy time (or trying to) with Borat's daughter. What I saw was him stupidly agreeing to finish the interview in the bedroom with an attractive; much younger woman and being a bit touchy-feely (patting her on her hip). What I also saw was a quick shot of him trying to get her hair or microphone or something out of a button or zipper on the top of her dress. It appears that we are missing the lead-up to this; like; perhaps; her asking for him to help her get unstuck) making it even more likely that it was edited to make it look like he was unbuttoning her to get her undressed. The press made a very big deal about him laying on the bed putting his hands down his pants ostensibly to touch his penis. What I saw was her taking his microphone unit from the waist of his pants (you can see it in her hand as she lifts her hands from his pants) and then he lays back to tuck his shirt back in; anyone else who is a bit overweight with a larger belly knows that this is an efficient way to get tucked back in. I understand that the Trump administration is a bunch of ass-clowns just asking to be made fun of; but let's at least show the real stupidity of these people without resorting to the very type of fakery that the conspiracy theorists point to as proof that the holocaust never occurred. And stop feeding the extreme left-wing nut-jobs at CNN and the New York Times.\",\n",

She did not change my mind since she was came across as annoying and ruined most of the scenes she was in. Also; it seemed she aimed for the ideology; that weird faces and loud noises equals funny. Instead she made it cringe worhty and at times i even had to skip her bits talking in the movie.Sacha Baron Cohen did a better performance; although at many times; he seemed off character such as the rally gig. There were also other times like the mike pence scene where he acts completely different. Therefore; the idea of disguising a disguised person did not work out in this case. I laughed perhaps at 3 occasions throughout the movie which was only Sacha\\'s single scenes.The scripted parts in the movie were terrible and Sacha should have focused on funny pranks instead of monotonous dialogues with Borat\\'s daughter.

Despite this; Borat is still far from a good film; leaning on some terrible comedy and its reputation for commercial success.In a similar vein to its predecessor; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a film that mocks itself; belittling genders; races and personal beliefs over the meagre 1.5 hour runtime. I know this is the point; but it doesn\\'t make watching any easier: particular jokes (one aimed at the Jewish community and another based around female puberty) were actually painful to witness; getting more of an embarrassed response than anything else. Behind these set pieces were some legitimately clever moments and even some properly written gags; but it wouldn\\'t be worth sitting through the dreg to get to them.In spite of this; the clever aspect of Borat is in his unassuming nature. By being naive and clueless (and at times extremist in his views); he lulls Americans into a false sense of security; which allows some insightful moments. My personal favourites included managing to extricate a Nazi salute from a Republican voter; whilst another showed the brutally honest misogyny of a southern man at a Debutante Ball. There is technically a \"story\" to this film as well; but it\\'s a stretch to call it worth paying attention to. Something that really irked me was the excessive green-screening used: clearly the budget did not extend to sending the cast and crew all over the globe; but not even having the energy to build a low-budget set on-site just looks careless to me.All in all; Borat was not good. It wasn\\'t very clever; it wasn\\'t very funny; but more than anything; it didn\\'t tell me anything about the crazy parts of the USA I didn\\'t already know.

       " 'When Sacha Baron Cohen puts on his mask; he removes everyone else\\'s. Often mistaken for mere racist caricatures; his stereotypical characters serve to confirm the biases of his unwitting documentary subjects (usually the voting American public and sometimes the very officials they\\'ve elected); effectively catfishing them into revealing even uglier sides of themselves.Unfortunately; his character of Borat is too well-known (and over-quoted) to make another pseudo-realist \"prank film\" without getting caught. That is; at least under the Borat Sagdiyev moniker (even as his latest film was produced pretty secretively). What if; oh I dunno... Borat himself was to put on disguises?As confirmed by 2018\\'s Who is America; Cohen does still know how to dupe voters; celebs; and public figures into unleashing their worst selves; and this extra-layered bit of trickery is no exception. Following the early screenings; Cohen\\'s latest prank was already making headlines; having caught cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani in the act of doing something not-much-better than that which he himself has attempted to ruin the Biden family for.In the movie; Borat\\'s near-feral and supposedly underaged daughter; Tutar (Maria Bakalova); joins the Kazakhstani reporter on his second trek to the United States; meeting such figures as Mike Pence and the aforementioned Giuliani on the way. Thing is; since Giuliani is one of Cohen\\'s victims; he is not a part of the film\\'s fiction (the same way Borat and his daughter are) - thus; when taking Tutar\\'s in-universe age as fact and nevertheless \"enjoying\" her in his sleeping quarters; he isn\\'t acting. Even if you don\\'t share Cohen\\'s biases; Giuliani having this sort of kerfuffle is a gloriously poetic bit of comedy.I don\\'t know that this boner (pun intended) will delegitimize criticisms of the Biden family; but I feel a great swell of pity for Giuliani; mainly because his top defenders include Mike Cernovich; ever selective with when he chooses to call out pedophilia (jokes on Twitter is usually what does it; not the actual act). In a defense of Giuliani; Cernovich asked why we don\\'t investigate Cohen - who; in the same footage; also seemed to believe Bakalova was no more than 15 and still made it possible that Giuliani brought her to his bed (by writing it so that Tutar will do anything to become \"next Queen Melania\").First of all; the actress isn\\'t actually 15. Second of all; Cohen was in-character as Borat; who does have a 15-year-old daughter in the form of the character portrayed by said actress. The only party who conceivably believed that Tutar was a real-life minor is the politician who tried to f-ck her; i.e. the person currently being defended by \"righteous; free-thinking reporters\".Basically; Cohen continues to stand out among contemporary comics. Matt Zoller Seitz summarized the film\\'s mission as \"positioning its hero as a depraved; narcissistic fool whose flaws and excesses mirror his clueless targets\\' so closely that they don\\'t realize they\\'re being made fun of; even when Cohen stops just short of hauling out a sign that reads; \\'YOU ARE THE JOKE\\'.\" He also eloquently describes the film\\'s ultimate point on America: \"For all its posturing as The Greatest Nation on Earth; the United States circa 2020 has more in common with a retrograde foreign backwater than its government or people like to admit.\"Much of Cohen\\'s Borat shtick has always been about how; on top of pretending to affirm the beliefs of bigots; the bogeyman said bigots like to rail against isn\\'t that far removed from themselves (in terms of how they view gender roles or religion or whatever); which becomes especially obvious when they actually start BONDING with the Borat figure. Notice how I\\'ve gone this far without mentioning mankinis or goofy catchphrases (or the beautifully idiotic way in which Borat combats the Coronavirus).

For all those not old enough to have watched Da Ali G Show on Channel 4 in the UK it was a surprising mix of both highbrow and lowbrow comedy loaded into a tightly spoken paraphrase. He didn't care who he made fun off it crossed all political and non political boundaries.

I understand he wanted to do an anti-Trump movie; and release it before the elections; but this is Borat. This is not the Cohen TV show. Borat is a figure that we enjoyed world wide and was the sarcasm of the capitilistic West and the former Soviet; looking for a modern identity; wannabe capitalistic but still Soviet East.

When I think about it; the only thing I would have liked more is if there were less parts of him playing Borat being disguised as somebody else. Because; I get he's an international celebrity; though the first film was 15 years ago; I think he could have gotten away with being Borat in public more. But it was hilarious with many wild moments. And his daughter; Titar; was outstanding; I would love a spin-off show or film just with her character.

He had to top his first movie by making this one even more cruder and offensive than the first; and at that he succeeded. In the Borat style; the film is clever and some of his anecdotes are brilliant and hilarious (leading the viewer to think he is about to call Trump a bad President; for instance; only to then say Obama was the dictator and Trump was a Strongman Savior)With that said; there is also a very dark side of this film which essentially is that Sacha Cohen is making light and poking fun at human trafficking. The entire plot revolved around giving his daughter as a bride to a rich powerful man; and at several points Borat says he is \"selling her to her new owner\". She is made to live in a cage and at several points Borat says he has raped her simply because he wanted to and had gotten her pregnant as a result.Honestly; at least in my opinion; the film does go a little bit too far especially since the real Kazakhstan; as with many of the former Soviet republics; does have a very serious problem with human trafficking. I\\'m sure some people will say its only a movie; and they would be right; but what if there were scenes of the daughter getting beaten or raped by multiple men and forced into prostitution. That is the reality that this movie is essentially making fun of and it wouldn\\'t be so funny then.',\n",

I get it people recognized him and that can be difficult and with saying that then I'm sorry don't make another movie then. This looked like a crash grab and or a political hit job to just say what everyone already hears in movies now which is trump sucks; vote Democrat. Okay we get it now can we get back to making movies funny and good again. I'm not political and sometimes I just don't want to hear it all the time when I just wanna sit back and watch a movie. I'm saying that there where some funny moments like when he's stuck inside with those two men other then that everything felt like the people where told there was a camera and didn't make it authentic. It was just weird to see a sequel of a movie that was such a cultural phenomenon and then completely make it about politics I mean everything was and then also making it very staged. So; in conclusion it was okay some funny parts but overall if I was to tell you that another borat movie came out you would not expect this kinda movie at all.

Naturally; things don't run smoothly and both Borat and his unwilling subject form an unlikely bond as the narrative progresses....I absolutely loved the original Borat and when I learned recently that a sequel was streaming on Amazon Prime I leapt at the chance and decided to watch it this evening. Whilst on the whole I enjoyed this sequel it's definitely missing something when compared to the original...It starts out well and there are several moments in the first 20 minutes or so that are very reminiscent of the original Borat film; there's the naivety and general sense of innocence with the character of Borat that we witnessed in the original film which were a big factor in making the original film work. However; in the sequel these aspects seem to be lost somewhere from 30 minutes onwards...Ok so the film is still fun and remains this way throughout; but the actual subtext to the story is extremely heavy-handed and somewhat unnecessary; somebody within the cast or production team is clearly heavily right-wing/republican and I did find that the serious political stance did take away from the film. This is offset at times by Borat and the republicans downplaying the virus (which does afford the film with some of its funnier moments); but what made the original film work so well is that you genuinely felt that you were watching an idiot go to America; make a fool of himself but with subtle winks to the camera.In this sequel the plot gets in the way far too much and the heavy-handed approach employed arguably takes away more than it adds (it's shamelessly right-wing and pro-Trump which for me regardless of your political allegiance) makes the film too self-aware and makes it less funny. Thankfully the film does get back on track from time to time (the idea that Borat has inadvertently injected himself with the virus and spread it around the world is where the film is strong and had the film focussed on this I think it would have been better - essentially seeing an idiot inadvertently creating a global pandemic)Still Sacha Baron Cohen is as brilliant as he always is and newcomer Maria Bakalova is also excellent (and her makeover transformation is incredible). Whilst the final scenes in the film were hilarious I found the heavy-handed politics a little too much at times. It almost felt like I was watching a lengthy pro-Republican/Anti-democratic broadcast (and the sheer number of Trump's cabinet that appeared in the film merely re-inforces this point making me think he either had a hand in bankrolling the film or somebody in the production crew was a big Republican).All that being said; this sequel to Borat made me laugh (a lot) and the ridiculous hyperbole surrounding the virus also resonated with me (I agree that it's all overhyped). This sequel is still good; but second time around things feel a little too serious and self-aware which tarnish the overall quality of this sequel.\",\n",
       " 'The original Borat was almost certainly the funniest thing Sacha Baron Cohen did. This film retreads similar ground in way that is quite difficult to distinguish from the original but it just doesn\\'t have the same vibe.Cohen is no different as Borat but the appendage of a clear political agenda to this film simply changes the character of the movie. Right wing Americans; Trump supporters; po-faced Christians etc just seem like not so much easy targets but incredibly predictable ones. The whole movie; framed around attempts to give Borat\\'s daughter away as some kind of sex gift; first to Pence and then Giuliani makes this film a piece of not remotely subtle political propaganda. In fact I almost hesitate to use the term because the kind of propaganda we encounter these days tries to disguise it\\'s purpose. Borat 2 at least has the decency not to do that. Sacha Baron clearly has very real political / ethical concerns about the illiberal nature of the Trump led Republican party & this film is simply about trying to damage the enemy.I can respect that I guess; but it makes it hard to take it as comedy in any kind of pure sense; which is something which really alters the movie; for however much Sacha Baron Cohen may remain the same very funny guy; he has lost his capacity to portray Borat as genuinely innocent.We experience this as a greater distance from the character; & the lack of something which was so important in the original film - the sense that at any moment Borat might do something truly shocking but innocent; so outrageous that it is cringeworthy. The problem here is though the shocking language & scatology come thick & fast they don\\'t have the same power to make us titter.The second main reason this is so is one the film addresses fairly early on: we know & Borat knows that most people already know all about him; that he\\'s famous & the possibility of milking comedy out of people caught completely off their guard has largely vanished. What this means in practice is that while we suspect that a lot of the film is basically scripted & performed by paid actors pretending to not know what is going on; where we suspect Borat might actually have caught someone unawares; we are still not sure it is a \\'real\\' encounter. It really isn\\'t Cohen\\'s fault that that is the case. He & the film-makers do their best to work around this but ultimately it is a huge weight round the film; even where the script is sound & the jokes are fairly objectively funny.In fact the only clearly unscripted events in the film are the gate-crashing of a Republican party convention where Pence is the guest speaker - the look on Pence\\'s face is priceless - a mixture of sadness & anger - & the interview with Rudy Giuliani. Rudy clearly does get suckered a little bit by Tutar; Borat\\'s much abused daughter; become journalist. It doesn\\'t look like anything would have happened but Giuliani is clearly charmed & flattered by the over-awed attention of the pretty young blonde woman with a confidence problem; who needs defending from her overbearing camerman (father). In fact it\\'s rather disconcerting how successfully they play Giuiliani in this way.There are some other funny bits. The beginning is quite funny. The absurdity doubling down on the calumies against Khazakstan as a nation are quite funny as is the idea that Khazakstanis are offended by holocaust-deniers because they are proud of their role in causing the holocaust (I\\'m fairly sure this is completely unfair to Khazakstan but who knows).But the jokes by and large are few & far between & mostly what we get - far more than in the original - is a story about Borat\\'s mission (to gift his daughter to Pence/Giuiliani) & the evolution of his relationship to his daughter.It\\'s here that something quite odd happens. While Borat seems slightly lame & stale; the daughter Tutar is actually really good. She has a genuine feel for the piss-take aspect of the Borat format; & seems a complete natural in the role; playing the almost savage caged downtrodden female (Borat\\'s Khazakstan seems to have doubled down on \"evil patriarchy\" since the last movie) with relish & really getting into the - probably best scene in the movie - the joint dance at the debutante scene. I said earlier that we were never quite sure whether the people getting sent up or outraged were real or actors - well I\\'m fairly sure the society figures & debutantes were real - the look of shock & disgust was almost certainly geniune & the same probably is true for the christian ladies who Tutar speaks out to later on.This aside the film dragged alot; & I never cared much about what happened. Sacha Baron Cohen is enormously talented; but he\\'s not quite as sympathetic as he used to be. Overall I preferred his Grimsby with Mark Strong over this by far.',\n",

       "'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm,Borat Make a *Glorious* #2! Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is very naiiice!America Mayor Rudolph Giuliani say he not like film.America Mayor Rudolph Giuliani say he very much LIE\\ndown to fix pants like in nation of Kazakhstan where we not stand up to tuck the shirt. Much success.You watch.Chin qui,What\\'s even funnier than the movie itself; is seeing people cry about it. I mean; damn; Cohen just exposes the stuff; he doesn\\'t make them say or do what they say and do. If you\\'re mad at anyone; be mad at the buffoons caught on tape. Or on second thought; keep being mad here; cause its hella hilarious.Great movie. Had richer; deeper laughs than the first; though not as many. Plus; it\\'s on Amazon; so you can basically watch it for what you already pay or get yourself a free trial.Great s#!^!,For those saying Giuliani was just tucking in his shirt; why lay down on a bed to do so instead of STANDING UP? And that; folks; is part of the genius of this film: that is shows you; live on video what\\'s going on; and lets those who want to continue to lie to themselves; to continue to do so; while being laughed at by others. Don\\'t miss it.,Nothing more needs to be said than: LOOK at the 1 ratings and the vehemence (and bad English) with which they try to dissuade you from watching Borat 2! You KNOW it has to be good.WATCH it.,Borat is back; with this subsequent moviefilm.\\nThis will be compared to the original to no end; but with borat being a cultural icon in America; this one was bound to be very different.I loved this film; it made me topple with laughter multiple times. The accomplishment of making this within a pandemic is also a massive achievement.\\nDo I think this is better then the first one? No.\\nDo I think this is a hilarious movie? Absolutely.This one seems a lot more planned narratively and has a lot more scripted scenes; not bad things at all.\\nThe girl playing borat\\'s daughter was also great.Very nice!,The Giuliani portion alone; makes this a must-watch. Can this administration get any CREEPIER? Why yes; it can!Speaking of .... the Fertility Dance; alone; is yet another reason to watch. It is not for the feint of heart; but it is like nothing (hopefully); you\\'ve ever seen before; or (hopefully); that you will ever see again.The rest is just icing ... and cake ... and a cherry. Maria Bakalova is ridiculously ADORABLE. Jeanise Jones is all heart.STOP CRYING; you insipid detractors! Relax just a little and LAUGH!,If you love Borat; you will understand that the bad reviews are the best reviews. Sacha Baron Cohen threw a bomb in our actual society... And I LOVED IT.\\nEvery sensitive issue that exists today; Cohen broke it with nothing more than the truth that is so much being concealed.\\nEven if the scenes are fake; he talked about subjects that no one really wanted to talk; and that\\'s why this movie is going to get controversial and some people will obviously hate it. But that was its objective and it means Sacha Baron Cohen did an amazing job.\\nI would write a longer review about this incredible movie; but it\\'s about those who see it that will know this movie is indisputably amazing.,Not as good as the first one (it doesn\\'t even come close); but still very funny at times. The actress who plays the daughter could be the next big thing; she is fantastic in her role.,I can\\'t deny I laughed pretty hard about 2 times and chuckled like 3 times; but most of the movie was a flatliner for me. I am a big fan of the first movie and I think where this one falls apart for me is that it focuses too much on current events (that the movie will probably be irrelevant in a few years); focuses way too much on politics and on the plot with Borat\\'s daughter. Many people are praising her performance here. I think she\\'s fine; but I don\\'t think the script is anything special here and it doesn\\'t help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself; but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original.,IMPORTANT before you begin the MovieFilm go to the subtitles and:\\n1) Turn on\\n2) switch to EnglishI realize this sounds obvious; but the default is OFF and the language of Kazakhstan (apparently). I wasted the first 20 minutes missing all the Textual humour because I couldn\\'t understand either the dialogue or text. After a second attempt; I was able to switch the subtitles to English which make the MovieFilm Very Nice.You really need English subtitles. Really. At first; I just thought the foreign subtitles were part of the joke. NOT!,I think this movie is a very solid demonstration of freedom of speech in USA and I envy it a lot.\\nI live in Turkey and I can\\'t imagine such a political satire movie of TR government being shown in our theaters or TVs without getting banned or somehow punished.\\nAmerican citizens are free to mock their government; president; his wife and their supporters in movies and mainstream media; and they are not labeled as \\'traitors\\' or get arrested for interrogation.,It\\'s Borat. Crude; offensive; and fun. It will probably get a bunch of 1\\'s from the poli-cry-babies who claim they aren\\'t judging it based on the fact that it goes against their values; but they are. It\\'s a stupid comedy and it was entertaining. If you don\\'t like stupid comedies then this just isn\\'t for you.,1st borat movie was brilliant because no one knew about the character at the time; this time it was horribly scripted and politically one sided. No where near as funny as the first one,All throughout the movie I couldn\\'t help but notice that most of the pranks are fake and unreal. I mean is there a single person in America that doesn\\'t recognize sacha baron cohen; even with tons of beard and hair and all that makeup. Screw republicans and democrats; screw trump and biden; screw politics; borat used to be a genuine comedy full of incredible extreme pranks ; but now it looks like a political garbage desperately trying to deliver a propaganda.,I really was excited for this movie but it didn\\'t deliver at all. It felt extremely rushed and the comedy wasn\\'t there. I laughed once during the entire movie. It\\'s obvious they had a deadline and pushed this out to meet it. This was a huge bummer. I wanted Borat not this.,Don\\'t see this if you don\\'t want to be entertained or experience cringe worthy moments but especially don\\'t see this if you don\\'t want to see a true breakout star in the hysterical and lovely; Maria Bakalova who reminds me of a young Tracy Ullman. She is amazing.,Borat 2 is just as funny as the first one. I missed half the movie because I was laughing so hard so I had to watch it again! 99% of these negative reviews are from Trumpers who hate anything that goes against their leader! They hate Hollywood; the left; or anyone else that tells the truth about their POS leader! If you want to laugh as hard as you have in a long time then go watch this movie!,If people think this is left-wing propaganda and the first Borat film didn\\'t poke fun at the right; clearly is not very observant! Borat was never for you; so stop with the faux outrage!This was hilarious. Not as good as the first but still hilarious. The scene in the clinic was all kinds of hysterical and cringy combined. The actress who played his daughter stole the show this timeVery nice...high five!!!!,The movie is fun; offensive; occasionally not for weak stomachs and obviously legendary already for the Giuliani bit.\\nBut Maria Bakalova as Borats daughter really kills it and I truly hope this opens the doors for her for a full fledged Hollywood career. I\\'ll keep my fingers crossed.,Brilliant and full of laughs within the first 10 minutes that continue. This has Borat in the title but Tutar Sagdiyev aka the daughter of Borat aka real name Maria Bakalova is a new star.,Borat 2 is an absolutely hilarious movie. The first one was so funny I thought there would be a let down but I was dead wrong because this was almost just as good. Sasha Baron Cohan is a genius!,Borat A subsequent movie film\\n2020\\n15\\nDirector: Jason Woliner\\nStarring: Sacha Baron Cohen; Maria Bakalova etcOverall rating 91/100Borat the subsequent moviefilm sees the return of Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) who must return to America in order to sell his daughter to powerful American politicians but he grows a connection with her. Well what can I say Borat 2 was bonkers and insane; but mostly brilliant; clever and had a lot more heart than the first film; so let\\'s get started.First of all the movie was very funny; had great comedic performances and chemistry as well as a fun set up. This movie was absolutely hilarious; even more outrageously funny than the first film; there was so many funny comedy skits; highlighting and cleverly taking the mick out of a lot of republicans and how they have handled many things; it\\'s humour was even more clever; and due to everything that\\'s going on right now gave even more comedic opportunities and satire for Borat to be involved with. The comedic performance from Sacha Baron Cohen was also as expected fantastic; he bought the character of Borat back to life perfectly with fantastic dialogue and his form of comedy and his comedic timing was excellent here; but also Maria Bakalova was fantastic here as well; she held her own with Sacha and in some places was even more funny than him; they both had excellent chemistry with each other and watching there relationship develop was great. The set up for the movie was also very fun; having the view of Kazakhstan being the complete opposite and Borat being forced out of the country set up the main plot point and new characters well; and was a creative way to develop the story.My only negative for the movie would be that they went slightly too far with some of the comedy. I did feel like the movie went slightly over the line with certain skits and costumes that felt more offensive than funny for me in places; the movie usually does a great job at being controversial but still able to get away with it; but I definitely think they went slightly too far in a couple of places.My final few positives would be the themes; links to real people; costumes and heartwarming moments. The movie had really great themes of really showing you how extreme and horrible a lot of Trump supporters opinions are and was a shocking but needed insight into the political divide in America; the links to real life people like Melania Trump or the random name drops and cameos for comedic effect were excellent and cleverly executed. The costume designs for Borat were also excellent and funny; due to the success of the first film Sacha was being recognised more by the public; so hats off to the costume team for providing very convincing and often hilarious costumes for Borat to wear. Finally the movie had a lot more heartwarming moments than the first film; the themes of women being capable of anything and that everyone is human and not so different was handled really well; with some genuinely kind and caring people involved within the film that was very sweet to watch.Overall Borat 2 a subsequent movie film; despite going slightly too far in places; is just as clever; outrageous and hilarious as the first film with a great new member of the cast and more heart than the first film.,Amazing; Sacha remains a genius.Fantastic work.As with all his work it\\'s amazing. He always uncovers such gross and frightening attitudes and opinions.,One or two raunchy laughs. Nothing special. Cannot even be compared to first film. The movie is about 90 minutes long; and 75 of it is somewhat boring.,I\\'be been a fan of SBC since he was Ali G on UK TV. Back then his comedy was a breath of fresh air. The first Borat film was hilarious as was Grimsby. But this effort fell flat and the dull story couldn\\'t be revived by the extreme vulgarity in the story. I don\\'t think I laughed more than a couple of times. Final verdict: terrible.,Borat and his \\'daughter\\' are fantastic!\\nTears in my eyes.\\nWe need more of this in these times!,Even it has loads of more or less light triggers I laughed way too often and I don\\'t regret it at all! Loved the first movie and the whole idea behind a soft scripted movie with a lot of improvisations and also dancer for Sacha Baron Cohen and the crew! Amazing what he\\'s doing just for make the audience laugh and tell his point of few.\\nWaiting for the next one ;),I thought it was way funnier than the first. Mr. Cohen is just so awesome and hilarious. The movie was funny all throughout. Would recommend.,The main appeal of part one was being able to observe the culture clash during the confrontations with real people out there in the wild. This one replaced all of that with cringe-worthy; Reality TV level fake BS. And the grand finale/scandal is clever editing and shameful practices at best; entrapment and defamation at worst. Most of the jokes and social commentary contained feel like someone rushed to harvest the lowest hanging fruit and turned them into an easily digested; yet nutritionally completely void sludge for the lowest common denominator audience. Strange to see from such a seemingly intelligent guy.,What a violent on American culture; the debutantes ball and their dance was great.Some Americans will not appreciate it; but the rest of us will laugh.,Subsequent Moviefilm follows the same basic premise as the first movie; Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as an outlandish character and travels across America pranking real American citizens; and revealing the true nature of normal people; from the good to the bad. This time however; instead of chasing after Pamela Anderson; Borat has his daughter with him; and hopes to marry her off to one of Trump\\'s political allies in order to earn a better reputation for glorious nation of Kazakhstan. This results in a much more interesting and engaging story; and gives us another character to get to know and really root for. Azamat; the producer in the first movie; was never given much attention as a character. He was just someone for Borat to feed off of. But Tutar is not treated the same way; and even has her own character arc and her own chances to prank people. Not to mention the twists and turns brought on by current events that were moulded into the story so effortlessly it\\'s hard to believe they started filming this last year before everything hit the fan. Not only is the pandemic slotted in so seamlessly; but it manages to elevate the movie - from a narrative standpoint - far above anything else Baron Cohen has done.Of course Borat is all about the pranks; and while the tighter narrative of the movie does make the whole affair feel a lot more scripted; it\\'s no less funnier for it (in fact it might debatably be funnier; but we\\'ll get there in a minute). Definite highlights include Tutar\\'s time with the Jeanise; the babysitter; who thought she was participating in a real documentary about teenage brides. What she puts up with from newcomer Maria Bakalova is astounding; and she comes across as the most effortlessly caring and wholesome person; doing what she can to change Tutar\\'s worldview. She\\'s also low-key hilarious by herself; such as her reaction to Tutar calling the Earth flat; or the way she points out that breast implants are not going to change much in Tutar\\'s life. Another entirely wholesome highlight is Borat\\'s 5-day stay with a couple of redneck guys who; while clearly misinformed themselves; do all they can to educate Borat. These are guys who think Coronavirus is fake; and avoid liberal people as much as they can; and yet they take a complete stranger into their home when he had nowhere to stay (at least to their knowledge); and offer assistance however they can. Baron Cohen dressed as Trump bursting in on a speech by Mike Pence; the constant back-and-forth with a poor postman and his fax machine; and the pair going to a pro-life health centre to remove a candy baby from Tutar are hilarious as well; while the Women\\'s Club and Debutante scenes are prime cuts of cringe and embarrassment.Between all of that and the more traditional comedy moments between Borat and Tutar; I would argue Subsequent Movefilm is a far funnier movie than the first Borat. The first had its moments for sure; but Subsequent Moviefilm is almost relentless with its jokes. It not only aims higher; but hits higher as well. The more obviously scripted nature of the film is bound to turn off some die-hard fans; but for me it meant the jokes were really worked on and refined in order to be as funny as they could possibly be. The best example of this is the Disney-parody of Melania Trump; and her first meeting with Trump; all in Disney-style cartoon. And then was the song Borat performs really written by the rednecks? I doubt it; it has Baron Cohen all over it. But that didn\\'t make his performance of it at the anti-mask rally any less hilarious to watch.\\nBut of course being a Borat movie; there\\'s more here than just the comedy. Beneath the jokes and pranks is more of a look at the highs and lows of American society. I\\'ve already mentioned how wholesome both the black babysitter and the rednecks were despite their political viewpoints; but it swings the other way as well. The pastor at the women\\'s health centre barely bats an eye at the implication that Borat impregnated his daughter; and in light of those revelations; still refuses Tutar\\'s right to an abortion. Not to mention the numerous occasions of unashamed creeps like the plastic surgeon who admits he would take advantage of Tutar was Borat not present; or Guiliani himself who did not come off in a particularly great light even before the moment of controversy. Then there\\'s the frightening situations of mob mentality Borat encounters; such as his prank on Mike Pence being met with the crowd chanting \"four more years\"; or his racist; misogynistic; and anti-Semitic song being welcomed and cheered on by a crowd of anti-maskers. Baron Cohen said himself that he was forced to wear a bulletproof vest on a couple of occasions; something he was never required to do for the first film.Some of this movie will not age well; most notably anything relating to coronavirus (which ended up being nearly half the movie); while other moments (again coronavirus related) have aged like a fine wine already. Baron Cohen appears so much more at home in the character of Borat than he ever was in the first movie; resulting in his pranks being so much more effective; as well his general acting making the whole affair a lot more convincing. Unfortunately for him; he discovered Maria Bakalova who is astonishing and gives it her all. There was not a single moment she wasted; and she committed one hundred percent to every gag and every prank; not only keeping up with Baron Cohen; but sometimes completely blowing him out of the water. Some people will hate the increased sense of script; while I feel the movie benefited greatly from it; and it\\'s still chock full of candid improv moments to keep it as Borat as always. I enjoyed this a lot more than the first movie; like it\\'s not even close. I could definitely see myself watching this again in the near future. I give it a very high 8/10 (so high I genuinely debated giving it a 9).,It\\'s just bad; 98% it\\'s all scripted and staged and the daughter\\'s scenes are not funny.\\nThe old Borat would have epic non staged scenes and he would make fun of anyone; doesn\\'t matter their political side; race or gender. In 2020 we would expect Borat to crash rallies; parades and cupcakes student councils. But nothing... Just staged unfunny stuff and same jokes all over again. Very disappointed. Just watch the old movies. This one is super boring.Basically he just played it safe. He\\'s afraid to be canceled so he just went after people that don\\'t go crazy on Twitter. Old Borat (and Bruno or Ali G) would never be afraid of being canceled.,Don\\'t get me wrong. I laughed myself silly quite a few times. But the tone of this sequel seemed off; and it took a while to realize the difference.In the original; Borat played such a complex; naive character; a true fish out of water. If you had encountered such a person in real life; you\\'d wholeheartedly want to help him. And that\\'s where the original\\'s hijinks started.Subtle character differences in this one; though. The seemingly sweet veneer was gone at times. Rather than having some more or less harmless fun with the unknowing participants; he struck a harsher mocking tone. Several scenes are rather cringeworthy. Some kind; decent people bent over backwards to help a guy in a bad spot; and caught nothing but crap for their efforts. I\\'d call that a big misfire; and it severely detracted from any desired comedic tone.,This movie is extremely stupid and not funny at all; the first one was better. Don\\'t waste your time,The original film was superb but this sequel is predictable; poorly written and just plain boring. Let me just put out there now that I\\'m no fan of Trump and my opinion is by no means biased. However the film tries too hard to smear conservatives and it just ends up looking desperate and unfunny.\\nFurthermore the sense of deja vu is overwhelming as SBC recycled far too much from the original and it just does not work in 2020. Introducing a significantly new character is often a sign of desperation and the introduction of Borat\\'s daughter Tutar is no exception. She\\'s like Scrappy doo in Scooby doo or the sand snakes in Game of thrones. Tutar is another awful character but I understand why she was necessary as Borat is too well known in 2020 to trick people into an interview. It begs the question was this film necessary? I would say definitely not. For me it has soured the Borat character and taken some shine from the original film. SBC is a genius but I can only imagine that he was forced into making this film for political reasons.,I\\'m European and as anti Trump as you can be; but it\\'s just not very good; it\\'s some silly acting with about 3 poor; unimportant pranks around potty humor. It\\'s not even as extreme as most of the news that comes out of the US; or Q Anon and other clowns on Facebook. If you want awkward; funny pranks that make you laugh; Impractical Jokers is funny; but this? This is just people watching someone be ridiculous; they don\\'t even interact this time round...,Tired and repetitive.\\nThe Borat character was mildly amusing in the first film. For about half an hour. There was nothing there that was even remotely funny and this second film reinforces that.\\nI am so reminded of the meerkats in the TV ads (they are unfunny and irritating also).\\nThis bloke has turned a ten minute sketch into a very unfunny career. A bit like Steve Coogan.,Not funny; not smart; a lampooning designed to appeal to the halfwitted.\\nYou will get more humour and intellect in the Great British Bake off.,This was unwatchable. I made it 37 minutes and realised it was utter garbage. Not funny at all. Not even tongue in cheek funny. Not even kindly amusing. Just tired. Very tired.,Just for the record; I\\'m not from the US. I expected the movie to be Anti Trump but this is a waste of time and not funny by a mile. Sasha lost it big time. Boring jokes; not even worth a chuckle,Loved Borat! This is weak in laughs; inauthentic character; boring! Wanted stop watching yet still hoped SOMETHING would redeem it. Nothing did.,Disappointed.after the first movie. Fake and disgusting from beginning to the end. I know you\\'re going to watch it regardless; at least know that you\\'ll be watching a third class movie.,It\\'s not funny; humour for people intellectually impaired; Coen is out of his tricks; terrible; offensive and simply stupid...better have a nap then watch Coehn turd... utterly disgusting; low level humor; avoid...how this get 7 starts?? go figure,This is bad. I used to like Sacha Baron Cohen; but; not anymore. All he ever does is dress up like some weird character and pretend to be dumb in the hope of tricking people into saying embarrassing things. What I really hate is that a lot of the people he tricks are just being nice and even trying to help him; but; he tries to frame it in such a way that they look like bad people. It is all just so his clique of liberal cosmopolitan elites can look down on Muslims and Christians. I will admit that Cohen is smart and capable of being funny; but; he is not as smart or funny as he thinks he is. I watched this with my family (who loved the first movie) and they did not laugh once during this film. It is all basically the same formula and really forced. I imagine this will get quite good reviews because he attacks Trump and most critics will love that; but; this is not a good movie. There really isn\\'t anything that was not already covered in the first movie. They did not need to make a sequel; it is really bad and a complete waste of time and money. Borat has officially jumped the shark.,Pretty much same old clichés. No longer funny. He\\'s a clever guy and has done some very good stuff but this is schoolboy humour. Very disappointing,I never saw the original movie. It just didn\\'t appeal to me. I ended up wanting to watch another comedy tonight so I threw this one on. I\\'ve never laughed so much. This movie was HILARIOUS to me! Call me immature; today; on my 39th birthday; but I found this humor wonderfully crude; politically incorrect; and a breathe of fresh air. I also loved the \"real world scenes\". Did he actually get these people to believe he was who he said he was??? That was amazing. I need an explanation. To Google I go lol.,Very nice 👍👍👍 would recommend. 10/10. Might make you fall asleep; but sleep is always nice so I don\\'t see that as a bad thing.,The first film was genuinely funny. This round; released on the eve of the last debate and a week before the election; is entirely motivated as a political party smear. Regardless of one\\'s particular politics i enjoy movies to get away from politics. At least a warning would be appreciated.,Tasteless ronthevpoint of not being the least bit funny.,Unfortunately; I can\\'t rate it less than one star. It\\'s not funny; stupid and disgusting. First Borat movie was bad; but this one hit the bottom.,Not funny like the first one. It must be because it had a purely political motive rather than a comedic motive.,First Borat movie is so much better and actually funny. This is just cringey mess with unfunny;forced daughter who just shouting nosenses whole time and thinks its funny. Which made whole movie unwatchable for me. Rather Watch Borat in Britain or Ali G,I mean if you didn\\'t like the comedy and rudeness of borat you will definitely not appreciate the comedy of this film either as it is 100 times ruder than the original beside from that it was a perfect sequel to a very creative and funny film the acting was brilliant and borat managed to yet again achieve his goal of once again showing people\\'s real ideas,We cant expect it to be as crude and funny as before sadly thanks to cancel culture but borat still pushes boundries . Entertaining for sure.,Discriminatory; while mocking discrimination. Sadly hypocritical film-making. A shame.,Nothing quite like trying to escape politics and watch some entertainment only to have it shoved down my throat in Borat 2. Loved Borat 1 but #2 was an obvious political tool that sort of ruined the series. Now I\\'m not a conservative but it would have been nice for the movie to follow the entertainment style that it provided in its last movie without diving into politics and current events. Entertainment is meant to escape from what\\'s going on currently; not to immerse ourselves in political manipulation.,One star; basically an hour and a half long political commercial.,In the shadow of the first film totally lacking the light-hearted energy and comedy gold of the original.All the same set ups as the old one but it all seems so dull; the energy isn\\'t there; and there is nothing new to pull it along.It becomes tired early on and relies on the Rudy Giuliani interview at the end to keep people holding onto the end; and then that\\'s an even bigger let down.Glad I pay to see it in the cinema; COVID has it\\'s perks.,I loved the first Borat movie - it\\'s a classic.\\nBut \"Borat 2\" is an absolute rubbish.\\nI think I could only bear the first 30 min. of it.\\nIt\\'s so not funny.....like in all Hollywood movies now - comedy seems to be dead.,I was so excited about this but it was a disaster!,Had high expectations based on the previous ones... bad is an understament slow comedy bad quietly and extremely corny...,It is clear that it is politically motivated which is a shame; therefore score is equivalent to that... I enjoyed Sascha while ago; where he never took any part and he mocked everyone equally; but this is a clearly movie targeting right wing voters and party with hidden agenda and releasing it one week before elections. Enough said... Sascha obviously lost his touch and/or he joined the leftist \"train\" just to keep his career rolling (like many of other hollywood actors).Really shame to see that.,Fake; not funny; and ridiculously misrepresentative of Americans. BS like this is why Trump will win another term.,I came with expectations of laughter and went out with disappointment,Don\\'t waste your time. Not funny like the original. Weak attempt to belittle conservatives.,A dreadful film full of desperate cheap laughs; it may have worked 13 years ago with the original but the format hasn\\'t aged well.\\nWas tough to even finish; don\\'t think I laughed or smiled at all throughout.Very disappointed.,This movie made every attempt to be funny; while being witty; and it was neither. It was painful to watch. Sacha Baron Cohen takes every possible liberal talking point and tries to make fun of conservative views.,This movie is even better than the first one............NOT!! Now that we all know the premise; after watching the first movie; the jokes all seem old and recycled. The first movie was funny because we loved watching people\\'s honest reaction to what they thought was a real documentary.Now; everyone is in on the joke so the jokes seem forced and not quite as \"real\". Having his daughter added to the mix just seemed like a desperate attempt to even get the movie made; as every knew who the Borat character really was; as shown in the beginning of the movie - with fans & autograph seekers wanting selfies taken with him.If you liked the first movie; like I did; I think you\\'ll be disappointed with this one.,Big fan of Borat; loved the first movie but what did i just watch!Terrible; boring; not funny; scripted; lazy! I think thats the end of cohen as a legitimate satirical comedian. He really lost the magic and the content is just dumb.I would rate this -10 if i could; thats how lazy the script writing; acting; content was!,Nothing like the first one;it raised a few giggles;but no laughs. Very politically biased;and obviously skewed in one direction. if you are fed up with this one sided bullying of people;and their voters;give this a strong pass;if you are of the type that is easilly manipulated by the likes of certain \"news\" organisations;and like to shout;or bark at people because you do not have a clear enough mentality to engage them in adult conversation;then you will love it. This \"movie\" is basically Baron Cohen in thick rimmed glasses;purple hair and a love Trumps hate placard in hand barking at the screen for ninety plus minutes.,One of the worst movie sequels I\\'ve ever seen. Totally played up on the gags of the original film and everything obviously scripted and staged. Cohen clearly was wanting a payday without having to create anything original.,Yawn....if you\\'re going to make a movie involving politics you at least need to poke fun at both sides (see the Hunt). Beyond that though; the humor Borat inspired worked because his character was so young and naive in the first one. With a much older Cohen; it\\'s much harder to pull off this role and get the same laughs. This is just the norm; Jim Carey can no longer pull off his Dumb and Dumber character as we saw. Chevy Chase lost all his humor around 40-50. Cohen must be hard up for money to go back to the Borat well.,It is fun; hilarious; the acting and improv is sound and commendable. It also offers a deeply troubling insight into what we are really willing to slide as our \\'normal\\'.And I am writing this review while just being half way through it.\\nBUT OH MY GOD I COULD NOT WAIT TO WRITE THIS REVIEW BECAUSE IT IS ALL OF THE ABOVE AND IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. WOOHOOO.,A sequel often is a disappointment 14 years a is a long time of expectations to build. Brave and brilliant with a heart while still being an interesting look at the world we live in.super sequel,I watched the first film the night before this came out & 14 years later that is still god dam hilarious! Now unfortunately watching that one first & then this the following night; was a lot to live up to & this film just didn\\'t..it felt like a crude dark attempt to make him relevant again; the originality of the first one wasn\\'t there; the American politics bashing was a bit lame as it\\'s like errr the rest are the world are gonna watch this & we don\\'t care about your biased views & digs at politicians it\\'s not funny to us; If anything it makes it less funny; more staged & quiet frankly a million miles away from the authenticity of the first. It really is a shame you couldn\\'t just leave it at that one film gem.,Garbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nYes; this review was helpful.,Such a shame; I absolutely loved the first film. The character of Borat has been weaponized by the left wing propaganda machine. A lot of these \"people\" who didn\\'t know who he was were obviously actors. I\\'m all for poking fun at the right; but this film was completely biased in one direction and made zero jokes and held no one accountable on the left. You guys should have just stuck to spoofing people instead of the \"orange man bad\" default crutch everyone falls back on when they run out of ideas. That is what made the original such a great film; little if any political agenda. This film just felt very lazy. The only time I felt like the old borat was back was during the father daughter dance scene; f@cking hilarious. Hollywood please stop preaching to your audience; and ruining modern cinema. Stick to creative and fun story telling. Leave politics out of my leisure time.,Remember when Sasha Baron Cohen was inventive ; fearless ; original and above all very funny ; before he started wearing his woke heart on his sleeve ; this godawful film is as funny as a cry for help .\\nIt is literally a gag an hour ; and they seem to have been written by Jason Manford ; Mike Read ; Jo Brand and Ted Rogers .\\nMakes Robin\\'s Nest look like The Producers .,The second Borat movie is a huge disappointment. It is nothing more than a political statement that misses the humour and absurdity of the first movie.,Doesn\\'t serve much purpose besides reinforcing the \\'Central Asians are uncivilised barbarians\\' stereotype and being a political propaganda tool to meddle with the American elections.\\nKazakhstan deserves more than an apology; Sacha Baron Cohen and the Borat team owes the Kazakh folk reparations for the irreversible damage that this abomination had caused to the international reputation of the country.,Sasha might have been funny once; but he\\'s lost his edge; in fact I wouldn\\'t even call this a comedy film; its more like a Russian Propaganda film; we didn\\'t even make the end of the film; turned it off after 40 minutes. If anyone else is thinking about it; I wouldn\\'t bother; in fact watching paint dry would be more entertaining ....,I loved the first Borat movie but this second try is really a bomb. It\\'s not funny at all.,Waste of time. Not funny and schematic. Offensive in a wrong way suppose to make it fresh but it did not. It is boring and predictable.,Not a patch on the original; I don\\'t think I laughed at all. Very contrived and fake. Low budget; cheap,This is not a movie; but a try to make money of the first movie; and at the same time shoving leftish propaganda down the audiences throats. If you like that; you like that movie. If you like your comedies be... well... funny; this is a huge waste of time. But; sure; some people will off course be rich from this crap. But remember it\\'s your money and your time you are giving them.,I regret to waste my time to watch this ridiculous movie.,Lame; monotonous; and childish middle school humor. Xenophobic stereotyping of another culture; so the xenophobic ethnocentrists are sure to love it. Waste of time at best.,It doesnt work like it did in the first! Politics just garbage. I cant sit through more past 23 minute just uggg no!!,Horrible tasteless humor. I couldn\\'t make it through the entire movie which contained juvenile humor and excruciating graphic display of female menstruation. Sasha Baron Cohen needs to find a new shtick! The only bright spot in this disaster of a movie is Maria Bakalova who should be a rising star if she can keep away from horrible productions such as this!,Probably a bad idea to watch before a dodger game but this was really bad. It\\'s not like his previous work of comedy. Everything was flat; fake scenes; fake chop; audio misplacement. Was a borat fan for part 1 but this whole movie was a snooze fest,Amm; this is beyond bad; unwatchable. Wasn\\'t a big fan of the first; but it was ok. This; just amazingly dismal.,This was the most cringe-worthy rubbish to be touted as comedy I have ever watched. Puerile; toilet humour that did nothing make me smile once. Someone pad a lot of money to make this film; and to have an untalented lead to front it.,This movie was too scripted compared to the original Borat.Also period blood is not funny it\\'s gross,The original was something new and had funny moments.\\nThis is like a comedian trying to make you laugh with the tenth retelling of a joke you already know. It\\'s no longer funny. And once the humor is gone; we are just left with mean spirited scenarios trying to mock and belittle unsuspecting people. I found it incredibly boring. I think I broke a smile a few times but I hope this is the end of Borat. It\\'s like Cohen is a one trick pony rehashing used setups. Time for something original.,I\\'m afraid I am only reviewing an hour as I turned this mess off.The original was a masterpiece; had me howling with laughter. This is absolute garbage; majority of it is scripted crap and the rest was poor.Nothing like the original please don\\'t go into this movie thinking you are going to get the same as part one.Rubbish.,Spoiler alert - I am not a Trump supporterI really enjoyed the original Borat - it was clever; funny & impactful - this character in the original movie reminded me of the role of the court jester - to speak truth to power.This follow up movie was shockingly disturbing.I felt gross after watching it.Sacha Cohen crossed the line in multiple ways in his attempt to make his points.His points are true & valid.His approach with this movie was dark; disrespectful & disturbing.As the court jester; he has such incredible talent & a global platform.This was just awful.,Unfortunately most of the jokes aren\\'t funny and story is so boring,Movie is total garbage; nothing shocking or new... Just banking on profanity...Story is absolutely predictable which it should not be for a borat movie...,Most of the jokes seem forced and designed to make a political point. The entire point of the movie is to paint mainstream Americans as dumb and worthless. The first one was actually funny; this one; not so much.,Loved the first one. Hate this one. Released before elections of course.,Then this movie is perfect for you. This is old school pranksters; knocking inside open anti-Trump doors. Boring if you are tired of this.,Loved it and laught first time; but this time... Cohen\\'s jokes are very outdated and worn out; everything is based on old kindergarten-level jokes for morons and for perverts. Always the same deranged jokes about supposedly endangered Jews and gays and mocking republicans but he does not dare to criticize leftists; Antifa terrorists; BLM or their politicians. Very politically colored; biased to the far left. And this with Giuliani is the only thing that raised dust in this miserable piece of trash. But actually it is nothing interesting. It\\'s all about Giuliani really adjusting his pants and microphones (the actress was helping him) and that was nothing indecent or shocking. And that\\'s actually the whole plot of all this rubbish - how to cheat and mock Republicans and Conservatives. Utterly disaster for low IQ children. Cohen is not funny any more and it is time somebody to tell him that.,The 10 star reviews will likely be from the whiny; entitiled Democrats of the US and A with an IQ of about the same as a potato and even Canadians like myself know exactly which backwards States they\\'re from. (cough California and New York),I remember watching Borat as a teen when it first came out. The whole crowd in the cinema was laughing almost all the way threw the movie. It was new it was unbelievably funny and it was so original. If you have not watched the second part please do the original movie and yourself a huge favor and DONT watch it! It\\'s basically an anti Trump movie right before the elections; but I don\\'t get the point. Will anyone watch it and believe that it\\'s not staged? The first movie was not that was clear but this? What\\'s the point of the part when he goes in the synagogue dressed as a Jew when it is know that the the lady who are there already knew that this was a set up? Wasn\\'t even funny. Who believes that the part when the three of them are in quarantine and come up with a song that he sings a day after is not staged? The whole movie seems fake and I can\\'t remember one part that was actually funny. Too bad he did a second part ; I hope he does not ruin Bruno if Trump wins the election... The worst is the way they edited the whole movie ; just check how the real rally he attended happened... Do your self a favor; and don\\'t watch it.,I don\\'t even know where to start. Ali G was awesome; OG Borat was awesome; Dictator was OK and this is the worst movie I watched in a long time. It\\'s like watching someone else trying to copy Borat and fails miserably. Maybe I had high expectations. Wouldn\\'t recommend to anyone except die hard fans to who the name of the movie is enough.,So they created a sex scandal with a prominent public figure. That is in no way comedy; it wasn\\'t even in her character.While the first movie was great with its absurdity; the way they tried to outdo themselves in this one came out mostly infantile; as if it was fan fiction. But was entertaining at times and the segment with ballroom was hysterical and very masterfully done.It all fell apart when the interview came along. Tutar completely fell out of character when she started using her actual real-world charms and gestures (that rub on his knee) as a lead in to get him into that bedroom. If she was in actual character; she would have pulled her pants down and showed him her bloody bush right there during the actual interview; asking him to marry her. Really disgusting what they did there. Everyone is now preoccupied with analyzing how some guy put his hand in his pants after a gorgeous woman dragged him into a bedroom and went on to \"remove his mic\".,Why why why?\\nFor as funny as the original borax movie was this is a contrived mess\\nBad editing to try and gain more impact\\nIf you\\'ve never seen the original 2006 movie\\nWatch that instead of this utter rubbishA movie title that should have been one and done,I think the charm that borat was searching for was to display a hilariously offensive character in the world and political climate of 2020. They managed to create some pretty funny scenarios for Borats character to encounter with clever writing; and great improvisation from the actors. Where the film kind of fell apart for me; was that they were trying to portray many of the scenes as if they were raw reactions and takes with \"real people\". They had scenes in department stores; health clinics; and other every day locations. Although it becomes glaringly apparent that the people Borat talks to are actors; or at least playing a part. It gives the film a feeling of inauthenticity and detracts from what I believe they are trying to do. At times the film also blurs the lines between what is clever and funny; and what is just unsettling and gross. Given the timing of this film and the US elections; it feels uninspired and rushed. Entertaining at times; but falls flat,The first one was witty and funny. The second is just lame!!!!,I\\'d say at least 95% of the negative reviews are coming from Trumpers and the right. Wonder why that is? They go around spewing their hate in droves and hate anything that tells facts about their leader! They also hate anything with diversity. Click on one of their profiles and I guarantee you that all their negative reviews are about shows that have any diversity in it. I have and it\\'s sickening. Just scroll down their reviews and they give any show that has a person of color; woman; gay person; etc a 1 or 2. They can\\'t stand that the world is changing and for the better!,This is a poor offering. There are a few mildly funny bits but the casual racism and gross bottom of the barrel subject matter had me turning the thing off half way through. Trump and Trumpism are ripe for parody but there are a thousand better ways to do it than this; which feels like it\\'s been written by a 12 year old boy who thinks he is being daring.,Don\\'t waste your time. Not even funny. Baron Cohen is just an activist; Jokes are political. If you are a liberal you will love it but if you are one of the common people you\\'ll find it disgusting.,Very much the Emperors New Clothes here; this is not social nor political commentary.The subjects are not the smartest of people. He doesn\\'t laugh with; he laughs at.What makes it worse; is Sascha Baron Cohen is a very competent actor; his turn in The Spy was excellent. And he spends his time making this?,Borat no make much funny movie. It stink from many no fun liberal poke at people Borat not fit to lick boots. No like much this movie because it no make me laugh. Borat just confused liberal making stinky movie for other confused liberals.,I actually enjoyed the first movie; but half way through this disaster of a movie; I just skipped ahead to see if it got better or even funny - I didn\\'t laugh at all. The political agenda is blatant and honestly mean spirited; one sided and NOT FUNNY!,Another Cohen masterpiece.. it\\'s obvious from the one star reviews that he was right on target.,The original Borat is the funniest movie I have seen. You could tell the interactions were genuine; and the movie didn\\'t have a political agenda. Unfortunately Borat 2 is nothing more than a political statement with interactions that seemed scripted. It is basically just a long anti Trump commercial.The addition of his daughter really hurt the movie too. She was not funny; and her acting obviously ruined any potentially authentic reactions. The only funny parts in the movie were when it was just Borat.,This is a lame sequel to a great original. While the original is well researched with solid characters; the Borat in this one is a man who is lost between being authentic character he was; and just another normal guy.Laughs are forced; with the exception of a couple of places where it is the usual Sacha.\\nAs a Sacha Baron Cohen fan; this was an utter disappointment.,Wow what did they do to borat?Its basically an anti trump propaganda movie.,The movie starts off well but anything that\\'s funny about the movie takes place in the first 10 minutes.\\nAfter that the movie is just a bad editing of poorly planned scenes together.\\nThe first movie was amazing but subsequent moviefilm reaches greater heights - Not!,I think you need to get Borat to see the funny side of this. The Americans are mesmerisingly obliging - no matter what they are asked to do and Borat and his daughter might as well be aliens. Hilarious.,Just such a waste of time.. not even funny; just cringe :/,The film seems rushed out and unfinished.I laughed for the first 8 minutes; silly voice; funny dialogue; odd Kazakhstan customs; then watched and cringed; and didn\\'t laugh as the scripted set pieces rolled in.Possible spoilers; but i doubt it.....I don\\'t get baby/doctor scene; why was this clever or funny; not explaining someone has swallowed a plastic toy and then expecting us to laugh at the poor doctor trying to help because he thinks the girls pregnant. The set up was poor and the joke was worse.Other scenes equally poor.Turned off after 56minutes.,Straight away I noticed his Borat voice was so poorly done. Sacha\\'s English accent kept slipping through and was just crap and off-putting. Lazy and rushed.This entire movie was a total $hit show from start to finish. Unfunny; pathetic stunts and pranks and unfunny dialogue. The period scene for example and saying to a doctor he put a baby inside his daughter....just not funny; and I\\'m no prudeIts a liberal propaganda film pathetically half disguised as a \\'comedy\\' yet theres nothing funny in Borat 2.Borat 2 is worlds away from the very funny original Borat. I felt depressed as hell after watching Borat 2. Sacha is a sell out shill and only made Borat 2 as a smear campaign against Trump.Pathetic film making.,An excellent movie; very enjoyable 👍 good job ✨ totally fully loaded with jokes. I have spent a Great time watching it. Good msg sent to the world. Positive.,Yeah that is a good movie watch you will enjoy it and will hate republican party forever!\\nand sacha really have noooo limit for his job and humer. his just wonderfulll!,Borat is back with a vengeance! Yes it\\'s more of the same sort of thing you\\'d expect but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat cringing (in a good way) throughout!The Rudy Giuliani scene is worth the wait. Believe me.I think Maria Bakalova has a bright future ahead of her as she seriously challenges Baron Cohen as to who is actually the funniest on this movie!I never thought we\\'d get a Borat sequel let alone one that actual managed to deliver.,I mean seriously the part one had genuinely funny moments and the whole concept itself made you wonder if it\\'s actually a movie or something that really happened! It was crazy and spot on.\\nPart 2 tries HARD to get the same going but fails in almost every aspect! Even the jokes feel lame and not original.\\nIf not for being bored; I don\\'t think would have even bothered to finish off the movie.\\nOverall; you can easily skip this one with absolutely NO REGRETS of having to miss on anything special.,It\\'s hilarious and brilliantly written; acted and improvised. It\\'s timing is impeccable. So awkward but in a good way.,Some laughs but mainly just something to skip through,This movie was so ridiculous it was painful to watch!,Even looking past the political propaganda bs; this movie was hard to watch more than half the time. All the daughter bits were boring. If he had made fun of both political sides; this movie could\\'ve been better. Imagine the reactions he would\\'ve gotten if he\\'d gone to a BLM rally dressed in MAGA merch. If he crashed a Biden rally; made fun of pelosi. Those would\\'ve been huge laughs. I\\'m not even really that bothered by the Trump jokes; but don\\'t be so biased about it. Go for both parties equally.,In my opinion Sacha baron cohen is one of the best comedians of all time; he\\'s an absolute genius and yes of course the second borat is really great and i enjoyed it so much.,Hilarious! Brilliant; bold; exposing! Real! The Bulgarian actress was perfect. The set up scenes were so well planned out. So much thought went into it. Perfectly exposes the current culture of humanity.,Whilst I appreciate that this is supposedly a satirical look at the USA I find it quite deplorable to continue to play into the hands of the Holocaust deniers. Also; the ridiculous amount of sexism & antisemitism is so shameful that I\\'d bet even Jim Davidson & the rest of the British 1970\\'s comedians would wince at.,Just a piece of democratic publicity. Horrible. Totally unfunny,Don\\'t waste your time. So obviously a set up with professional actors and not the slightest bit funny. The sets are so sparse and staged.,This was a good one time watch but it is is no way a match to the predecessor . Sure it does has its own funny scenes a lot of them but sometimes it felt as if the screen were scripted and even if they aren\\'t they lacked the surprise thing/unpredictability like in the first part .Sacha Cohen was amazing as always with his comedic timing ; the girl also did a pretty decent job . Overall a good one time watch .,None of the humor or charm of the original.\\nThis exaggerated corpse is brought back to life solely to awkwardly push a heavy handed political message.,Far more politically exposing than the first; Borat 2 is a raw expose of US power and political relations far beyond slapstick humour. The inconsistencies in American right-wing factional thought; mysogynism and the moral laxity of an uninformed; conspiracy theory touting conservative base is brought to light with some intelligent humour and outright outrageous scenes. This is smarter than a mere 90 mins of pranks -- this is a message of how compromised American democracy is today.,Waited all this time for this; sat down with friends ready to cringe and laugh; and either we all just got old between films; or we loved it; and just couldn\\'t laugh through our masks. A couple of strong laughs; but I\\'m reading reviews saying 9/10 and wondering what these people watched. No Luenell Either? I\\'m seeing that the bad reviews are woke and saying \"Republicans or rednecks won\\'t like it\" of course people have to get political and not just watch it; and what would republicans be mad about; Giuliani scene was cringey more than funny; and if you didn\\'t want to hang out with the cabin boys after; you clearly are enjoying 2020 being locked in. From my group what I could tell is; if you liked the daughter character you liked it a lot; if you didn\\'t; obviously you won\\'t. I probably should give it a 4; or a 7; but I guess to me it was like watching the sixth sense a second time. That\\'s probably a dumb analogy; but I couldn\\'t get past the novelty had worn off. I think I laughed more the 5 minutes before we watched it; talking about Borat 1; then during.,As much as I wanted this to be good; it was a disaster. the reports and reviews from others really got me excited; those folks need to broaden their horizons if this is doing it for them. I found the whole way through was a struggle to stay engaged; the humour was mild and few and far between... all in all forget this one SBC,As someone who would not be too offended by much or on any political divide I feel I am worthy of a fairly unbiased review. This film is truly atrocious. It speaks volumes that he had to return to an old character which lets be honest is past its sell by date. Whether this was because SBC is stuck for new material; money or is so desperate to push his own political agenda...it doesn\\'t really matter; it should still be somewhat intelligent and entertaining. It\\'s not; it\\'s crass; crude; dumb toilet humour; fart jokes included. If this is your thing; go watch some of the scary movie series; at least that doesn\\'t want to ram some political agenda down your throat at the same time as having to watch pure dumb unfunny muck.,I\\'m not a political person at all. Don\\'t lean one way or the other with it. It\\'s just not something that interests me.Unfortunately; this film just is all about bashing the president... and that\\'s all. Honestly; though; it\\'s not about the subject matter.. it could have been about anything; It\\'s that it\\'s like the same joke over and over and it just gets tired.Did not seem like Borat at all.,The first movie was very good and made fun of everyone and everything. This new one is a reflection of the political bias of pop culture in today\\'s society. I laughed at several parts but this has nowhere near the comedy of the first.It\\'s very one sided. I\\'m pretty centrist but I could tell how biased this movie is. They only went after republicans. I wish that he would have gone after Democrats and their supporters too.I was thinking maybe he would go after the other side but it never happened. He just mocked Trump supporters by finding the most extreme ones. The ending just seemed like a very anti American message much like everything coming out of Hollywood today.This movie was good for a few good laughs but that\\'s about it. I think Sasha Baren Cohen could\\'ve done so much better,It had extreme political views compared with Borat 1; I think his daughter was a waste of time in the movie but probably the movie was motivated by feminists. It had very pro-Zionist views on things.,I loved the first but this was terrible. The inclusion of his daughter was unneeded. By all means; have another character for Borat to interact with but get somebody who can do improv. His daughter ruined many scenes by laughing as Baron Coen ad-libbed. Too many scripted scenes and the terrible disguises (apparently needed because he is such a recognisable character now) ruin it.,Seems to have been made with an agendaI used to like most of his filmsBiggest laugh is some hair on the armpits if you find that funny,From the Russian Hoax; to Biden sniffing people; to cancel culture - the left wasn\\'t touched with a 10 ft pole.\\nIt not only was all \\'Trump-centric\\' - it wasn\\'t based upon the real jokes to be made; it was based upon the caricature of the right that the left tell themselves is the truth.\\nAnd the worst part - that was the funniest parts.\\n70% of the movie is about him and his daughter; with the same joke being rehashed 100 different ways.\\nIf you liked the 1st Borat; it is at least watchable for a one-time viewing; so I gave it 3/10. But I\\'d watch the 1st 100xs over before ever watching this again.,I liked it; everyone gets so upset when their political views get made fun of. It\\'s fine; people have opposing views. I like jokes about both sides and borat 2 had me cracking up and uncomfortable; overall it was very enjoyable. 8/10 but I\\'m offsetting the 1/10 votes by people who can\\'t take a joke,Don\\'t waste your time ; absolute drivel ; enjoyed the first one but this is completely unfunny,At least the first one had some funny moments just because of the absurd nature of the scenes and his anonymity.This one is unfunny; cliched and just plain stupid. And of course it\\'s supposed to be a hatchet job on republicans; but even clever editing and out of context footage can\\'t save this piece of crap.Not worth a watch.,SBC used to be funny and ground breaking; this is just tired same old shock you with cringe stuff that\\'s really not amusing; laced with the woke narrative that Hollywood can\\'t do without; disappointing and dull,I laughed a few times at the start of the movie and then I realised it was rubbish. Such a shame. I was well up for a good laugh. Didn\\'t happen.,With any SBC film you kinda know what you\\'re going to get; and this doesn\\'t disappoint. It is simultaneously hilarious; uncomfortable; genius; depraved; and jaw dropping in its brutal exposure of ignorance.The highlight is actually the actor who plays Borats daughter (Maria Balakova) Great performance and very gutsy lady to perform like that under what must be bizarre circumstances. Also; the scene shot in a Synagogue with a pair of elderly Jewish ladies is very touching indeed.It\\'s obvious that filming was caught out by Covid; and the ending a little rushed; but overall it works very well.,I\\'ve watched it at least 3 times this week! Hilarious! Plays off the first one fantastically!,Borat: do you like my new MovieFilm ?Me: yesBorat: it is great like my previous MovieFilm ?Me: supBorat: 👍🏻 !VERY NICE!👍🏻,The original Borat; I watched 20+ times; loved it. But this new one really is terrible. Not funny at all.,This movie is even better than the first one; I laughed so much; and humor is very dark; I definitely recommend you to watch it ;),Funny with some really hilarious moments; with one or two slow bits preventing me giving a 10.,If you laugh while pulling off wings of flies; this is for you. It\\'s a poor; uninspired repeat of the first movie. Making fun of Southerners (already done); Texans (done); and Republicans (done again). I don\\'t know if this was purely a money grab or political panic from just another Hollywood creator.,I\\'m not a US citizen; not a Repulican nor a fan of Trump. Having said that this movie feels lazy; safe; boring; predictable and extremely one sided. Being released so close to elections it\\'s not even trying to hide its intentions. It\\'s picking the most easiest targets. The Christians and Republicans. What\\'s so brave about that? Of course there will be no consequences. If he wanted to make something meaningful; he should\\'ve mixed it up a bit. There are many things to expose about American society; or society in general; on either side of the argument. Of course people on the other side of spectrum; people who are not mocked here; will like it. And they are not entirely virtuous and without flaws. Not entirely blameless. And what\\'s so righteous about that? Mocking people on the other side and not being entirely truthful. Where is the risk? Where is the effort? People who agree with him will say it\\'s funny; it\\'s great; and people who disagree will hate it. Like I said in the beginning. Lazy; safe; boring; predictable; makes me sick is what it is.,Its ironic that the movie is about an actor who is deceiving the supposedly less intelligent members of the southern united states as I\\'m assuming the audience won\\'t be those who have been targeted in the movie leaving the \\'intelligent\\' northerners to enjoy the movie?This brings me to my point; which is simply that to enjoy the movie you would have to either have an I.Q lower than the national average or have an I.Q still in development i.e that of a child but as the movie is rated \\'R\\' I\\'m going to assume no responsible parent would let their child watch the movie. So who the movie is aimed at is quite the mystery.The critics reviews are also perplexing as reading their reviews they talk about an average movie at best which gets good in the last half hour if you stick with it but its not as good as the first and yet they are still awarding it 4 or 4.5 star out of 5Its clear there is an agenda in the movie but it seems utterly lost in a what is a confusing movie. It shows a lot of shops selling things to Borat and his daughter and ignoring anything they say to make the sale; is that a dig at capitalism or just the greed of humanity?It shows a woman showing genuine concern for Borat\\'s daughter and her proposed plastic surgery and her lack of understanding of her body.It shows the Russel family take in a foreigner during a national epidemic and tolerate his cultural differences; it also tries to highlight their \\'southern prejudices\\' as they talk about Democrats drinking blood.It then shows Borat in disguise singing a song about injecting the virus and the crowd are singing along then the Russel family help to reunite Borat and his daughter.I wanted to turn the movie off after the first twenty minutes but having read the reviews I stuck with it to see the good last half hour but even then its just a slog.Honestly; the only shocking thing about this movie is the high reviews its been getting.,Quoting the NY Times: He said he moved in with two conspiracy theorists for a few days to show \"that they\\'re ordinary folks who are good people; who have just been fed this diet of lies\".Well if Cohen is not feeding us lies here; he probably has done QAnon a favor. Those guys are clearly in on the joke and indeed look agreeable besides Borat. I bet they do not regret a single word. It actually looks like *they* got *him* to sing their Wuhan flu song at the rally.The movie has some funny moments but this - together with the absolutely irresponsible attempt at Giuliani - ruined it for me.,Don\\'t listen to critics so much and form your own opinions; anyone with no sense of humor will pick this movie apart,Sacha has lost his touch ; definitely trying to push an agenda and isn\\'t even funny while doing it. Borat was one of the best movies I\\'d ever seen. This is a terrible follow up.,It\\'s unbelievable how extreme today\\'s views in politics have become. Hopefully this movie gets a few people thinking,Awesome and a complete fun ride in entirety. Best Comic Actor there is ; Good Direction and Actress did good too .\\nLove you Borat :),This movie has an obvious political agenda and ain\\'t afraid to hide it. The show provides the viewers an illusion of honest interactions between Borat and (supposedly) average American Republicans who appears to be oblivious to the cameras. For a movie that tries to get authentic reactions felt like it missed the bar and paid. The only people I found authentic are the doctor at the pro life clinic; the Trump supporters at the rally and all of them who got their faces blurred at the concert. ***SPOILERS**** Besides that the only authentic reaction from a person that I believe is Rudy Giuliani where Borat\\'s daughter took advantage of Giuliani\\'s kindness (and naivety) by pretending to be a journalist and having an interview with him. After the interview has concluded you can see Borat\\'s daughter setting up Giuliani by pretending to help him remove the wires from his clothes. Then Borat rushes into the room saying to take him instead of his daughter insinuating that Giuliani is a creep who is willing to get in bed with an underage girl (at least to the audience with heavy and nearly perfect editing).Sure the movie is funny at times and had some good cringe worthy scenes in there. But it ain\\'t enough to redeem it especially when there is a decisive motive behind it. Like one scene in the movies insinuates black trump supporters complementing trump on twitter of Facebook are fake and made by spammers from a third world country. Sure laughter brings people together but the laughter that Cohen provides is one that\\'s only decisive and adds fuel to the fire.,Well just finished watching Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and it was absolutely hilarious. I\\'m guessing the reviewers leaving 1-star reviews don\\'t understand satire; there\\'s no doubt clever people will get it. The ending wraps it up nicely with dare I say a fulfilling sense of pride. Very much a product of its time; and I for one am looking forward to revisiting it in five or ten years time and reflecting back on this period we\\'re all going through.\\nAnd; why do people say \"I couldn\\'t even watch 10 minutes of it\" and then leave a review? YOU\\'RE NOT QUALIFIED if you don\\'t watch the whole thing! It really demonstrates the unintelligence of the \"reviewer\".,Their motives are very transparent. Rushed out in order to influence the 2020 election results. And not even funny! I\\'m greatly disappointed.,I absolutely adored the original as it was shown for everyone and the jokes were amazingly offensive meanwhile staying funny.\\nI\\'m not sensitive at all and I laugh at absolutely everything that\\'s deemed horrible to others; but\\nThe second one.\\nIt just applies to Americans. Good thing I watched it through a trial and not on a subscription as it was not worth it at all.\\nThere were exactly 4 times I laughed at this movie. The most at the Jewish part in the church(But also only the beginning) and the very end when they\\'re reporting.\\nThis was such an American propaganda it was painful for me to watch.\\nAlmost all the movie was scripted unlike the original and it was not funny.\\nThe original one had genuine reactions from people but this was just plain and boring.\\nI wouldn\\'t even think about watching this dumpsterfire again. I\\'d rather watch the original for the nth time.,There were a couple funny parts; but really this is a juvenile movie that set out to make fun of American conservatives. The humor is very cringey; and appeals mostly to an immature audience.,I couldn\\'t even get through the first half hour; he\\'s alot older now and his borat voice is shot. The voice alone ruined it for me. Maybe ill try again in a few days.,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel that\\'s as good; if not better; than it\\'s predecessor. It\\'s reliably funny; shocking and extremely relevant. Sacha Baron Cohen is once again perfect with Maria Bakalova giving an equally fearless performance. The majority of the jokes are really funny and shocking making up for the few that aren\\'t as good. It\\'s extremely well paced and Jason Woliner\\'s direction is great. The music by Erran Baron Cohen is fantastic.,This movie is the absolute disgrace.Within 30 minutes of watching I realized I had no idea what Im watching and just turned it off.There was absolutely nothing funny about it; no jokes; no laughs; just one disgraceful non funny joke after the other.This is absolutely the worst type of cinema one can get.,Borat. This was some Michelangelo level humor. I\\'m a fan for life. Thank you for giving the world something to laugh at during this pandemic.,I watched this sequel to the first Borat movie and I wholeheartedly recommend this one. It has a well written storyline while speaking volumes regarding the American condition. His costar as his daughter is captivating and believable and the whole film is actually told with heart if you can belive that. When you can; check out the many back stories regarding the making of the film which will give incredible insight to it\\'s making on Youtube.,As always Cohen delivers a gem! This has a plot and well designed story line that carved its humor like a slice of apple pie!,I enjoy this movie! For sure it is not the best comedy of the century but can make you laugh.,Had the same humor as the first one but seemed much more thought out and planned; and the girl that played the daughter was great! So crazy that Sacha Baron Cohen got the Vp and the presidents lawyer like that lol,Well done Sacha Baron Cohen. This movie really made me laugh from the heart. Thank you also for choosing the best actress for your daughter. As a Bulgarian and mostly her friend; I am really pround and happy. You all deserve nominations and Oscar\\'s! I cannot believe how hard it was to act all the time and do such a great performance. I am waiting the next movies of her with big impatience. I always knew it she will climb to the top of Hollywood some day. And here is the day. This movie made me very very happy.,Unlike the first movie this movie is just democratic party agenda and attacking trump and the republicans . a very weak sequel . it aint funny at all there are some funny moments but in comparison to borat 1 its nothing,I love Sacha Barron but this movie is completely a disaster. if you respect for your time don\\'t even come close to this movie.,I LOVED Borat when it first came out. I was a huge fan that first movie I could NOT... and I mean NOT stop laughing. So with this one I was expecting it to be hilarious just as the first one. And I GOT that. Everything that Sacha did was hilarious and his daughter played by Maria Bakalova was brilliant in the movie ; I swear I though she WAS Sacha\\'s daughter. They both played it so good. Everything made me laugh and it was so funny to a pulp. Is it better than the first movie.... NO. Was it just as good.... Yes. This movie has the most offensive stuff in it. From Women to race to gender to everything even the pandemic was JOKED in this movie. PLEASE if you get easily offended.... please don\\'t bother on watching it. I for one can take a joke of race;gender; sexualty etc. I though this film did it\\'s best and it is one of my favorite of 2020 (Not saying much since a lot have left 2020 to 2021) 9/10.,This is the best documentary of 2020...much more well-researched and fact-based than Plandemic!,This movie is nothing but stupid. No witty puns; double entendres; zingers; just more of Borat being crude beyond measure. Adolescent humor at its lowest.,The main source of pleasure from watching any segment of Borat (or movie in general) is watching \"normal\" people who find themselves in unfamiliar situations trying to get out of such difficult circumstances. The first Borat was mostly apolitical; interested in exposing American hypocrisy. Well; as it happens; the truth is stranger than fiction; even if the concept of truth simply does not exist in this case. The continuation; of course; is more like a propaganda campaign for Biden; but it must be said that it took Cohen 14 years to get Borat back on the screens. Realizing that this character was a victim of his own success and could no longer fool people; the Kazakh reporter\\'s sequel is exhumed with all possible cynicism: he has evolved in the right direction and is not a blind copy of the original; yet the sequel has added interesting; relevant ideas to the modern world.,Wow. my jaw was dropped for a large portion of this movie. and it had me cracking up throughout. like a continuation of Who Is America? but with our favorite character. i\\'ve said this before and i\\'ll say it again... sacha baron cohen is a genius. no one can do what he does. he is amazing at it.i never thought we\\'d get another borat movie after the original destroyed the world of comedy (top 2 comedy of all time). but we did. and it was amazing. (1 viewing; 10/23/2020),I\\'m not going to lie; it\\'s mad impressive that the Redneck song was somehow way funnier in the actual context of this movie than watching it happen in real life all those months ago.,You can go for its awesome so many valgur scene buy funny too just keep that in mind,Not sure who this film is for...obviously not me. While I enjoyed the first one; the second film isn\\'t all that funny. If you want shocking; this is your film. If you want to see the genitals of a monkey (No; Really) this is your film. Pretty tasteless actually. But I\\'ll give it to Borat; the film has its funny moments; and when I say funny I mean gut busting. Maybe I\\'ll give the film a second chance. But until then my rating stands. Heck I\\'d rather watch Joker (2019) again and I despise that movie. Watch at your own risk. If you want to fully enjoy the film; watch it with your spouse or friends. I watched it with my mom. She was appalled by what was happening in the film. She thought the previews were funny but the film not so much. Vile; disgusting; humorous; horrible; unique and it shows the true flaws of America. As I said before; not my film. And definitely not my mommas film. So guess who will be in church Sunday? This guy....,This is nothing more than Baron Cohen being the political activist he is. Still kinda funny but it\\'s a shame the virtue signalers of hollyweird keep pushing their entitled narrative,This movie was incredible I haven\\'t laughed this hard at a movie in years!! I highly recommend watching it,I loved this film; was happy to see the Macon purity ball put on blast. Thank you for doing what you do Sasha!,Sasha Baron Cohen is back as Borat; the intrepid journalist; and this time he mostly takes on McDonald Trump and Mike Pence. If you are a MAGA hat wearing viewer; you will be offended; but for all others; you will love Borat. It begins with our star in a gulag for offending his nation in the first film. He is released to bring honor to his nation by delivering a gift to Mike Pence. At first it is a monkey but later turns out to be his teenage daughter. Not as good as the first film; but still very funny.,I had to see this subsequent moviefilm in a slightly inebriated state of mind. I didn\\'t wanna watch this sober. But I laughed. And I laughed. Many times. Borat delivered again. I would have given it a higher mark than a 7 if it wasn\\'t for the Giuliani part. That segment felt a bit like an unfair ambush.\\nMaria Bakalova; however; did great. Kudos to her!,Should come with a warning; if you\\'re not interested in American politics give it a miss.,It\\'s a drag. Starts out pretty good with some laughs in great Borat style. But where the first movie carried momentum through seemingly unscripted events which felt true; this sequel is 100% scripted.,I forced myself to watch it to the very end with some hope that the movie would prove me wrong. Sadly I was wrong and I feel robbed for wasting my time and endured so much pain and torture with this horror film. The Borat sequel film is nothing like the original film It stinks more than rotting flesh and feels like you are receiving a lobotomy with every minute of watching it. It\\'s like Sacha had nothing at all to do with the production except play a roll. I\\'m actually embarrassed for Sacha and myself. Wow. If there is a god; let it remove this movie from Earth and all existence.,That\\'s the real October surprise\\nHe showed the real red necks and the real Qnaon stories,This film was everything I expected; and in 2020 the humour of this film on my screen just makes it so much better; hopefully this can be the start of this sort of humour bringing its way back; yes people will complain because they have nothing better to do with their lives; but if you\\'re like me and enjoy laughing then don\\'t hesitate to watch this movieVERY NICE,I had never seen a Borat film before and only did so this time because of the media buzz. While I did not find the film very funny; I absolutely loved how the film exposed the hypocrisy of sleazy old Rudy. He lied about not doing \"anything inappropriate.\" Aside from that; there were scenes I did not find funny but rather gross.,I thought the first film was ok; funny but just a bit much; I found this one to actually be really smart; I\\'m unsure how much of its staged; I mean the Rudy bit especially is just scary dodgy; I\\'m from the uk and I feel for Americans; such a huge country obviously differs from here but with guns; morons in charge and the vast gap in education between areas I couldn\\'t imagine a worse place to live. I know parts are ok but being real it\\'s just a dangerous place.The truths here were close to home but true; I saw so many rallies during lockdown in the USA compared to few if any here; I actually agree the virus is man made; I think the bat things just a lie. 2020 has been horrific and at times where many countries came together the USA is divided. Joke of a president who deserves jail... or drinking disinfectant,You either like SCB or you don\\'t . I thought the movie wad hilarious and Borat and his daughter were a great duo . Obviously some are not going to like it but if you like a little satire in this scary time it\\'s a great laugh .,I am amazed by all forms of media in the last couple of years provide no escape from politics. I just wan to watch something to leave reality behind for a few.,I hope he never stops making those films. Yes they are daring and extreme but also shows the truth. Fantastic that he exposed the old creeps,While I had some good laughs; recording people without their consent is not ethical. It will get media attention and good sell/revenue; but that\\'s not ethical way to make money in my opinion!! I would also argue there is hidden political agenda in making of this movie!! Just not best 2 hours of my life!!,Usually when you watch a good comedy; you just laugh the whole time.Sadly for this movie; I cringed more times than I laughed. Not funny at all; especially the Holocaust prank.,There were a few moments when I laughed; but Borat as a character isn\\'t relevant anymore. He doesn\\'t have that anonymity to fool people and the situations are incredibly staged.,Bit disappointed with this film; I guess the character has reached the end of the road. I loved the first movie and most of Baron Cohen\\'s characters but this one felt a bit forced and not as funny as before.,I couldn\\'t believe they were going to make another borat movie; nor did I expect it to be as good as the first one; it\\'s a very good movie. If you like dark humor you really have to see it.,Borat is back; with this subsequent moviefilm. This will be compared to the original to no end; but with borat being a cultural icon in America; this one was bound to be very different.I loved this film; it made me topple with laughter multiple times. The accomplishment of making this within a pandemic is also a massive achievement. Do I think this is better then the first one? No. Do I think this is a hilarious movie? Absolutely.,How many people have been offended by this film gets an extra star for making Leigh Francis weep.Great film!!!!!,I loved the first one and this one is just as good. It may have been a little more staged; but I laughed as much as the last.The rating is so obviously being brought down by a certain type. Why do they bother to watch it at all; knowing what this satire is about?I actually liked the ending of this one better; probably because of the scripting. Nonetheless; good for a laugh.,The best funny film of 2020 is not at a theater near you (even closed cinemas in NYC and LA) but on your Fire Tablet and TV and also the prime video app on consoles and smart tvs. It\\'s Borat Subsequent Moviefilm; the sequel to the box office surprise hit Borat from 2006 which was the first movie I saw at the AMC in Rockaway; NJ during its opening weekend and have since seen it a few times on DVD and on TV. 14 years after the original; about a Kazakhstan man making fun of the USA; finds Borat on a mission to find Rudy Guiliani and his GOP friends on a quest to raise his daughter which soon gets lost. Hilariousness ensues and there\\'s lots of jokes and action in just 90+ minutes. Highly recommended and it might be nominated for some Oscar bait!!!,In an interview with Good Morning America Cohen admits that he believes the Giuliani was only fixing his shirt. But he tells then also that people are allowed to interpret for themselves. It is undeniable how uncomfortable Sacha is willing to push people to be so open. In the last movie I felt i comfy and shocked by the things people sad but I wasn\\'t completely thrown aback. The faces we see and recognize in this wonderful concoction of modern fear are haunting. It\\'s not just an innocent bystander. It\\'s topical and it\\'s brutally raw. Sadly it is a little one sided at points; which doesn\\'t make for a thorough watch if you are looking to feel like everyone is getting it handed to them. Absolutely enjoyable if you are looking to be frightened by the state of America. It can be worryingly too close to home and surely isn\\'t for the faint of heart.,It has been a long time since I laughed out loud so much at a comedy movie! Much better than the first one and very clever. The actress who played the daughter was brilliant too and a great addition to the storyline.,This is not only disgusting but extremely offensive! If you have any decency at all I don\\'t advise watching. For sure keep innocent eyes and ears of children away from this horrible so called movie.,If you can look past that there\\'s nothing new compared to the last 2.,No originality and too much fake scenes. Bad direction there!\\nAround the unsuspected people there are 2 or three moving cameras. Those are studio takes; made believe as \"hidden camera\". Very offending to the viewer\\'s IQ!\\nAlso; too many \"Kazakstanian\" dialogues; too many!\\nI love S. B. Cohen but that film was a Titanic (the shipwreck; not the movie)\\nLastly it\\'s obvious that Giuliani is fixing his shirt.,So sad that it takes a comic genius to highlight the ugly side of the US&A,Enjoyed the first Borat film but this was pitiful. Felt very staged; humour was base and tried to use unimaginative crass humour to drive the storyline; which in itself was pretty much non existent.Really struggled to watch to the end; with few laughs and nothing substantial that resembled any sort of meaningful social commentary on the current state of politics in the US. Contrived and lacking anything interesting bar a slightly creepy Rudy Guliiani - which seems to be the only selling point the media have latched on to (which is maybe a hint at how bad the rest of the content is for those bothered to watch to the end).For what it\\'s worth; I\\'m from the UK; left leaning politically and very much anti Trump and his lackeys; which maybe makes the missed opportunity to do something clever and insightful; the biggest disappointment.,I have never laughed so hard.Cohen went after them all: countries that see women as second hand citizens and who\\'s only purpose is to obey. He portrayed Melania as a \\'\\'lucky one\\'\\' for living in a gold cage rather than in a normal one. I think Giuliani was under the impression he is going to get lucky. Kind of reminded me of \\'\\'The Limo \\'\\' episode in Seinfeld where George was close to getting lucky to a nazi simpathiser. The Facebook touch was also brilliant as more and more people believe stories on their Facebook feed which could really be written by anyone who wants to have a laugh at the expense of gullible people. If you don\\'t allready have prime get it and watch this movie. Nobody portraits the tragic reality we live in better than Borat!,Comparing Borat to Borat 2 is like comparing Disney\\'s animated Aladdin to Aladdin 2.This is a political film that makes fun of Republicans and Kazakhstanis; and its targeted toward today\\'s college students.\\nSacha is riding the waves of where the money is; instead of doing anything original; like the first film.None of the big pranks are funny; but a couple of the less random; smaller jokes and gags; are.All Leftists will enjoy the film. Everyone else; will either not see it; or if they do; they will feel let down.,Impactful. Meaningful. Worthy. Dark. Comedy. Naked Truth. Thank you for your courage and boldness; Cinema - are few words that come to my mind after watching this movie.,The movie might be 7+ rating however 10 when one thinks of the odds of making such a movie and not getting - arrested; punched; catching covid; is an achievement. Including the dialogs where retakes are not possible.Not sure timing of Borats entrance in hotel bedroom was deliberate or just coincidence that users were left to decide whether (avoiding taking names) was tucking in shirt or was going to beyond that.And it\\'s not just for comedy; it\\'s made for getting the message out on what\\'s wrong with ~30-40% of America that got such an administration and it\\'s supporting cronies elected.,Just when we thought satire was lost; here\\'s borat.,I did not understand what people loved about the first movie because that type of humour is not my thing. The 2nd movie is pure genius. I laughed out loud throughout; but the laughs are not what makes this movie great. Borat 2 is a satirical look down the rabbit of current day America. We need more movies that point out the absurdity of current events.,When reality as become a parody; laughing at it\\'s buffoons is mandatory. If you didn\\'t like the movie; the joke was probably on you.,Typical mainstream shill movie. I\\'d get the same effect if I watched CNN for 2 hours. Skip this one and watch the original.,The last Borat was hilarious; this one felt like another Republican hit job from Hollywood.,If you weren\\'t a fan of the original Borat film; then this probably won\\'t be a hit with you. If however; you were laughing at Cohen\\'s antics in the original film; then you will know what to expect and will probably love it.Maria Bakalova was a co-star more than a supporting actress - likely down to Borat\\'s notoriety from the original film - and the script relied heavily on her being convincing in her interactions with the American public. She pulled it off well.The standout moment featured Rudy Giuliani. Will be interesting to see how much damage that does to him...,As expected from part 1 I got lot more fun but please don\\'t watch with your family,All the conservative yanks will be furious and leaving bad reviews to this movie; but that\\'s just them crying out loud because they don\\'t like to be criticized nor to be exposed on how their society and culture are imploding. But all those bad reviews mean that this movie it\\'s a political satire masterpiece!This movie trashes very hard the behaviour and stupidity of American rednecks and their political leaders.God Bless Sacha Baron Cohen!,WHAT A GEM !!! Not until Borat #1 could I have found any value for SBC; since then he brought an authentic Comic Genius for those who dare.\\nI would have predicted \"One and Done\" after the 1st Bora; as\\nit seemed INCONCIEVABLE that there could ever be another made....BUT Gullible was I; this one is a TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!\\nAside from the expected inappropriate yet laughable sacrilegious antics; anti-Semitism; racism; misogynistic themes; etc... again were the scenes where \"simple American country folk\" appear to be portrayed as if ignorant to the decade; in which some actually are; and they ain\\'t acting.\\nBUT this time even the True Blue N.Y.C.\\'s Ex-Mayor; the actual Personal Attorney to the POTUS himself; RUDY G. was truly CLUELESS to the semi-private situation he was in as he \"FIDDLED ABOUT\"; not knowing just how not-private it really was.\\nOk; so he\\'s just another well-known senile and demented \"Dirty Old Man\" politician; but were \"his people\" not aware enough to protect him from himself? All he had to do was admit he had a great time participating in Borat 2 and acting along it for fun\"; but he is not even that wise.WELCOME & BRAVO to Maria Bakalova; as she partnered up perfectly with SBC to double the comedic delivery of a much-needed \"roll with the times\" escape from the overflowing Year of DRAMA that 2020 has been; and still with a POTUS election yet to go.,As a big fan of the original Borat film; I was obviously excited when the sequel was announced. However; I was fully aware of the stigma regarding sequels; and I tapered my expectations. Much to my surprise; I found the 2nd installment to be very enjoyable. Just like the original; The Subsequent Moviefilm has a large handful of shocking and laugh-out-loud moments. Borat 2 also has many somewhat amusing jokes; and several gags that aren\\'t that funny; but this is to be expected from nearly any comedy these days. My only real criticism of the sequel is that it feels very relevant to the current events of 2020; so it may not be nearly as funny in five years or so. All in all; Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel of the original.,Although this film is not as funny or shocking as the first Borat film; it is still thoroughly entertaining; shocking and full of the excruciating scenes one would expect from Borat. Sacha\\'s writing and delivery are superb. I loved the addition of his daughter; played brilliantly by Maria B; although there was an element of poignancy with her character.,This guy has the balls to pull of things like nobody else can\\nBorat makes you uncomfortable so that yu can understand what it really means\\nFreaking hilariously,It was fine; but seeing all the great reviews make me want to review it less. What are you seeing that I\\'m not? I wish I could elaborate more; all I can say is that it\\'s what I expected. A super commercialized version of borat.,Borat 2 is as amazing as the first one and touches on some of America\\'s political problems. Sacha Baron gives an amazing performance along with his \"daughter\" that is Golden Globe or even Oscar worthy. And thinking that he did it within a pandemic; pranking some of America\\'s highest political figures without them knowing that they were being filmed for a movie; makes it much more fun.\\nGive this film a watch and you won\\'t be disappointed. It\\'s NIICE.\\nHIGH FIVE.,Sacha does it again. I started the movie thinking this is going to be so silly stupid. It\\'s actually really creative and had me crying laughing more than once.,This movie is very dumb and anopropriate. Sasha himself is very ignorant person who makes fun of other cultures. I guess for most people it will be a bug shock but Kazakhstan where the main character is from is a real beautiful country. The way borat exposes it is very offensive. If you like jokes about pubes and period I guess this is a movie for you.,I liked it but 1st is still close to heart. But i would love to see more.,It\\'s been a while since I laughed out loud to some comedy. Really rib tickling stuff. A must watch if you like funny movies. But if find it offensive you have to take it lightly to enjoy it.,I really loved it but all tho I still prefer there first movie,Really looked forward to watching this; wish I hadn\\'t bothered. Not funny in the slightest. Awful.,As a non-american user;I really liked the movie .\\nIn its politically incorrect way of humor; Borat manages to destroy every certainty of every American and at the same time show the corrupt sides of the most glorious nation in the world.\\nThe fact that the movie was shot during the election campaign made me even more happy.\\nA movie that unfortunately a lot of people will hate; thanks to its nature; but that many will understand over the time.,Don\\'t listen to all the 1/10 reviews. This movie is the opposite of being \"anti-woman\"; it seems a lot of people are missing the fact that you\\'re not supposed to agree with Borat; but laugh at how the people of a supposedly more civilized country react to him.\\nI honestly it holds up decently compared to the first one; sure it has a lot more scripted scene and the storyline is more coherent; but the fact that SBC can still get those kind of reactions out of people years after he reached worldwide fame is honestly jawdropping.\\nHuge shoutout to Maria Bakalova; she was absolutely hilarious as Borat\\'s daughter.,Sadly this is time I won\\'t get back in my life. I went into watching this hoping for at least a few laughs but I couldn\\'t muster even one. It felt very one-sided in who he\\'s targeting (which is likely the point). After viewing this I likely won\\'t be watching another Sasha Baron Cohen film.,Borat - the character which will be remembered all the time and perhaps would have been thought over for why they did not make more out of it! This one really is a good sequel to its decade long release. Its vulgar and disgusting but yet very entertaining!\\nWanna have more of this!,Brilliant haven\\'t seen a movie like this in a while\\nHad me laughing like crazy\\nA must watch with family\\nIf u have a sense of humour you\\'ll love this\\nIt\\'s better to laugh then wine about things\\nEnjoy life,Was a big fan of Ali-G but after that Sasha has gone down hill. I watched with high hopes but honestly didn\\'t laugh once from beginning to end. This movie is nothing more than a desperate attempt to defeat Trump with last minute votes and only uses mainstream media lies. It is very obvious to anyone with have a brain. But I\\'m sure liberals had a good laugh they have much lower standards and we\\'re probably high while watching.,A lot of offended republicans rated the movie with 1/10 still the movie made it to 7.2/10. I hope this is a forecast of the coming election.,If you rated this movie less than five stars then you either didn\\'t watch it or skipped straight to the Giuliani part.,A great and very funny/clever/ audacious follow -up to his previous Borat masterpieces. Poor old dumb the dumber Giuliani caught unaware and unprepared,This demographic for this film seems to be 12-year-old boys. I did not find it to be in the least bit funny.Much of this film is extremely insulting towards women: women in cages; women menstruating; women\\'s breasts; women being sold as property; etc. I got so fed up with all this; I didn\\'t finish the film.The misogynism was bad enough. But adding insult to injury; the insults were not even funny. They just made me cringe.My favorite film genre is satire. But to be effective; satire has to be subtle: Broad enough to let viewers feel good about being in on the joke; but not so broad the film seems to be endorsing the very things it is supposedly lampooning. Sacha Cohen badly overstepped.,Don\\'t waste your time with this lowbrow mindless garbage.\\n.,Yes; 35 minutes; that\\'s when I stopped watching. I tried; I really tried because I believe to make an educated comment; one must go through the process.However I could not go through with it. it\\'s pathetically idiotic; not funny; not even shocking; not really offensive.... it... it... it\\'s just ... I have no words.Simply put; a complete waste of time and bandwidth.,About 3 minutes worth watching. 1.5hrs of wasted time.,I really enjoyed this film; clever; hilarious and surprisingly heartwarming. If you liked the first movie you will certainly like the second.,Superb ; hilarious ; provocative ; a must see for all who wants Borat\\'s assessment of the current political climate,Borat and Maria; are amazing actors do not feel shame like the rest of us; which allows him to do some legendary hilarious and cringeworthy performances; while giving an important message at the same time.,I went in expecting a few laughs; and I got much more. Having read some reviews that\\'ve been posted; I thought I\\'d weigh in my opinion.Sure the movie had some obvious staged scenes; but there were a lot of genuine reactions by innocent bystanders. For example; the dance scene at the ball was genuine; Michael Pence; the scene with Trump\\'s lawyer; as well as the song at the rally.Some say the ending was rushed; but in my opinion; the ending tied the movie\\'s plot VERY NICEly together. I had a hard time believing that Khazakhstan\\'s president would send Borat on a mission as ridiculous as delivering a gift to Trump\\'s second in line; just to get in the \"big boys club\".\\nSo; for me; the ending made perfect sense.I\\'m entitled to my views; and everyone else to their own :),Not as sharp and fresh as the original; but \\'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\\' is still sharp and very enjoyable nonetheless. It is a hilarious and brilliantly astute commentary on current events and the social and political landscape of America. Sacha Baron Cohen is still hilarious while Maria Bakalova steals the show.,It has been a very difficult year; but this film is what we needed. I never expected this to be as funny as the first film.\\nSacha Baron Cohen embodies Borat & he is great at eliciting scripted/genuine ignorance from the public. However; the performance from Maria Bakalova as his daughter Tutar that brings heart to this film. It is an enjoyable film & I would recommend this.,I loved this movie! I am a Trump fan but I do have a sense of humor & I gave this a 10! I\\'ve been watching scary movies for the last 2 weeks so it was a change to watch a comedy. I watched by myself and literally laughed OUT LOUD at least every 5-10 minutes!. I love Sacha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova was excellent in her role. They had me in tears I was laughing so hard. I needed a great comedy to watch and it\\'s hard to find one that keeps my attention; I will be watching again for a nonstop LOLfest! Thank you for making this for us especially at a time where we could all use cracking up in a good way!,Disregard the negative reviews. They are all from Republicans or uptight prudes (also Republicans). There is nothing in the trailer or Cohen\\'s history that leads you to believe that this is a wholesome family film. It is exactly what we come to expect from Cohen\\'s brilliant docu-comedies; a sophomoric and hilarious satire on the many flaws of American society and he has a LOT of material to work with.,For almost 2 hours I forgot it was 2020 and the world felt like a better place. This movie was so entertaining!!,Even better than the first movie; and extremely relevant to current events. Great acting; and lots of original humour.Without a doubt; anyone who gives this a bad rating (or downvotes this comment) was simply offended at how stupid it made them; or the people like them look. Bring in the cringey trump supporters who can\\'t take a joke.SBC has always obviously been left leaning; and if that offends you; there\\'s a good chance you won\\'t like this film.,His follow-up is insanity... how does he get away with it!!!🤣🤣. Phenomenal comedy!,From a \"faith-based\" Women\\'s Clinic to Georgia debutante ball; Borat goes where few journalists dare and exposes our not so hidden hypocrisy in the process. I laughed. I cringed. I saw Rudy Guliani expose himself for the creep he is.\\nThank you; Sacha Baron Cohen. By the way; is it true that Melania named her son after you?,Sasha is giving us a few laughs and some serious warnings if you can see beneath the humor. This movie should be seen by everyone in the world and a wake up call to people.\\nSasha is wide awake in a world full of sleeping sheep. This movie is full of TRUTH. But the Truth can be scary if you know where the world is heading.\\nLook below the fake comedic facade for the scary truth.,Borat and his daughter are hilarious. Satire for sure. Love the fat suit and the disguise,What worked:Sacha Baron Cohen is at it again in his subsequent moviefilm. Cohen; playing Kazakhstan journalist Borat must travel back to America and offer a gift to President Trump to make up for embarrassing Kazakhstan in the first Borat movie.There were a lot of hilarious scenes from Borat visiting a religious doctor\\'s office asking the doctor to take out his daughter\\'s \\'baby\\'; to Borat bursting into CPAC and the Rudy Giuliani scene.If you want a good laugh; I can\\'t think of anything better right now.,I wasn\\'t a Borat fan; but the second part is better than the first part! Politicians in America should learn something from this movie!\\nI give 10 stars to the movie!,... and for all the right reasons. Some genuinely laugh out loud moments leave you under no illusion just how talented Sacha Baron Cohen is as he ridicules some particularly odious and obnoxious characters; cultures; traditions and beliefs. With outstanding support from Maria Bakalova; you might be surprised how immune you\\'ve become to fascism in the land of the free but at least you\\'ll do it with tears streaming down the side of your face and; quite possibly; a blub or two as the satire and mockery is gradually absorbed and starts to sink in.,I really liked this film; I laughed non stop all the way through. I love the first movie and would say this is as funny if not funnier. Definitely something to watch if you just want to have a good laugh; and who doesn\\'t need that after the year we\\'ve had so far. 10 out of 10 in my books 👍🏼,Borat does what he does the best that is messing with the culture of extreme black and white. The upside of this movie over the previous one is it\\'s story which follows proper order in the midst of all the commotions. Borat\\'s daughter adds additional entertaining performance to Sacha Baron incredible comic relief. Nothing could be better to relieve stress than Borat in covid 19 era...lol,I tried to like it; but SBC hit a wall a long time ago.,Borat 2 was laugh out loud funny at times; but certainly not enough to warrant an 8/10. The story actually had some coherence rather than feeling like a prank show and even had some solid emotion; but that still can\\'t account for its 8/10 status. What drove it up for me was how expertly executed these secret filmings must have been. Sure everyone has to sign a release to show their face in the film afterwards; but to corner some people to the point that they want/need to is mind boggling. As far as films that have a number one goal of shoving a political message in my face; this has to be my favorite.,The sequel to Borat - Borat Subsequent Moviefilm - is extremely clever; and definitely funny at times. This film once again proves that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most successful comedians who can expose the most misguided (or utterly repugnant) corners of America. Yes; this is a comedy; yes it is extreme and vulgar at times; but there are so many truths in this film. Definitely makes one step back and think about what parts of America are like. RUDY GIULIANI- I think got a little of what he deserves; given that he is a snake and a repulsive old man.,It\\'s uncomfortable; laughable; maddening and it is heartbreaking.Borat returns 14 years after exposing the dark underbelly of our country only to discover that it\\'s no longer hidden beneath the surface. This film exposes a level of racism; bigotry and stupidity that have become commonplace.But however disturbing (and it really is incredibly sickening) much of the film is to watch; Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) and Tutor (Maria Bakalova) manage to create a thread of hope throughout the film.This was unlike the first Borat. But in 2020 it had to be. Watch this.,In these awful times; just what we needed. Genius; Sasha.,Consistent laughs; great movie. A master of making people say stupid things,While the film was a lil short and rushed; it was still a good delivery despite the circumstances that they had making it. Brilliantly trolling and making the petals cry.,The funniest actor with the best movie in the whole world ; Sacha Baron Cohen :),It\\'s a really funny movie; everything is just exceptionally good.,This will definitely trigger those who call others \"snowflakes\" because they are thin skinned and don\\'t understand irony.,Thank you sacha for showing the bigotry and the nice people as well of this country; this was a great movie and if you can\\'t watch this with an open mind you are missing out; keep doing what you do man. Big up,This is so poor compared to the first one! A sour lefty pushing his agenda against Trump. Should have stuck to Ali G; and retired. Let your wife- who has talent earn the money!!,Guy 1: hes so funny looking\\nguy 2: *hated thus moodie*,I am a long time fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; and eagerly anticipated a sequel to one of the funniest films ever made; Borat. Unfortunately; this is probably his worst work yet; and along with his comic genius; he has produced a few clangers. This is the worst yet.Unfortunately; almost everything is painfully staged; and the few candid moments; would have been left on the cutting room floor; had there been anything else to string the film together.\\nNewcomer Maria Bakalova does her best; and manages to drive the very few and far between candid and humorous moments in the film.This sequel should not have been made.,Unfortunately it\\'s hard for SBC to be Borat in public; as it\\'s evident he is recognised everywhere; this is made clear very early on.\\nSBC playing Borat playing someone else; is a level of genius; however doesn\\'t enable the raw outrageous antics of Borat Sagdiyev.\\nA lot of effort was put into this; it\\'s clear; and the same disruptive pranks are followed throughout.,Its most of what you would expect. Hilarious; uncomfortable; and mostly shocking. If im being honest it reminds me more of \"Who Is America\" but I was a big fan. If you like seeing the real side of people; then I\\'d definitely check this out. Even if you don\\'t like what you see.,Was happy when I found out that a new Borat movie was released.Unfortunately this is very far from comedy. Didn\\'t laugh even once. All I see is leftist political activism. Sasha Cohen has unfortunately disappointed with this one.This was more like Who is America part 2.,This movie is a gut punch to the fringe (or now mainstream?) right-wing. It is Borat\\'s fearless; vulgar take down of American ignorance. Some fans are disappointed that the movie is too overtly political; with targets like QANON and MAGA; how can Cohen resist? The most sympathetic; endearing characters in the film are the real-life Black and Jewish women who try to save the misguided Borat and his show-stealing \"daughter.\" This is a movie that shocks the system; but that is why it is precisely right for the time. WARNING: If you support the idea that Democrats drink baby blood; this might not be the movie for you.,It\\'s fascinating to me how Sacha Baron Cohen writes & acts in such mockumentaries than when he is in a drama. The sheer range of this man is absolutely amazing. \"Borat\" took everybody by surprise for its narrative and \"Subsequent MovieFilm\" raises the bar and ends on a warm; touching note. It is hilarious from the get-go; all the punches land & obviously SBC doesn\\'t pull his punches back. Some scenes are uncomfortable yet hilarious. Loved Maria Bakalova! Her chemistry with SBC is fabulous. The social commentary was a big addition to the political conversation. Loved everything about the movie and I\\'m sure I can watch it multiple times!,It\\'s often hard for a sequel to live up to the original; but this came pretty darn close. The daughter was a very smart twist that differentiated it from the original. Also considering that it was filmed during COVID; I\\'m very pleased with the outcome.,The only low scores will be from upset redneck and Mcdonald Trump fans. They are shown up for the gullible idiots they are by Sacha and how he brings covid into the story as it happened live and surely altered the ending he had oringally planned is just pure genius.The first was funnier; this one is more important.,Lenny Bruce pushed the limits in his day by cursing; SBC does it by splashing lewd and disgusting imagery into your face. This is not comedy. It is offensive no matter what your politics.,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is great! It manages to recreate the bizarre tone and vibrancy of the first film and updates the story to feel very 2020 with some excellent satire; social commentary and several standout hilarious segments. Sacha Baron Cohen is still not afraid to offend you and remains excellent at doing so. Maria Bakalova is an instant comedy star as his daughter Tutar (truly a new icon of the genre). I will never forget the fertility dance; as long as I live. 🤣 There\\'s also a bit of unexpected character depth and pathos which I didn\\'t expect from this movie. This unlikely father-daughter story just works. 👏,Loved it; Borat is back -- and how !! More irreverent and politically incorrect than ever. I haven\\'t laughed this hard in a while. Thank you S.B.Cohen for giving us something to laugh our heads off; in this time of gloom.,Just what we need in these dark times; something to lighten the mood with some belly laughs. The actress that plays his daughter is amazing; as it the guy at the fax shop. As always; shines a light on the farce that is america and its politics at the moment. Let\\'s hope Borat is the saviour that can sort things out.,The phrase; \"Give em enough rope to hang themselves\"; was never more true! At times hilarious; at times disturbing; never boring. SBC does a good job of showing some people who were genuinely kind and compassionate as well; which restores a certain degree of faith in the US of A. Even; at times; some of those who he is lampooning are portrayed with a degree of humanity; not just caricatures. They are shown as misinformed; yet caring and hard-working. The actions of Rudy G; the gold-digger; and others; however; speak for themselves. TBH; If you have more than one Trump sign in your yard and need your daily Sean Hannity fix; you will probably hate it.,Yes; it\\'s heavily political. Yes; some scenes will shock you. But considering we\\'re days away from what may be the most important election of our lives; I believe this is a great tool to remind us of some of the horrible things going on of which we have become desensitized. Watch it asap!,I had a great time watching this. I would definitely recommend this to you.,This movie is a work of art in a politically tenseful time. It can potentially trigger both Democrats and Republicans . Expected for 2 sensitive groups that only see each other as red and blue.The movie itself flows really good. The skits are hard to tell if real or not . But after reading more info on the actors ; there\\'s no way you could of wrote that type of material . It flowed too natural out of those people\\'s mouth\\'s for not being actors . A lot of organic humors momentsVery good movie. Not as offensive as the first one but still good enough to stand on it\\'s own. I hope he makes tons of cash off it .,Brilliant funny heart warming current virus times .,This movie has nothing to do with the first film; it\\'s just election year propaganda.,Very sad about seeing a movie made just for politics reasons. And it was no funny at all.,The worst film; if that\\'s what you can call it; I\\'ve ever seen. Didn\\'t laugh once and was clearly paid for by Amazon to have a poke at Trump supporters and Trump before the election.\\nAnother example of how low the Elite will stop to try and fool the public. How wrong they wereSasha should be ashamed for this political stunt for money,Not as good as first. Still decent albeit nauseating at times.,This is definitely in line with the spirit of the first movie but it does give off a vibe of \"recycled material\". There are definitely some funny moments but some of them felt very scripted; after looking into it a bit more; it\\'s been confirmed some of them were staged (not all of them though) and that is also taking away some of the charm. Still a pretty funny comedy overall if like me you like this type of humor.,I was a big fan of the first Borat movie but this one is just embarrassing. Tries too hard to slag republicans and fails huge. Don\\'t bother wasting an hour and a half.,So my favourite character of all time; as with all the rest on this sick times; was brought back to life simply to destroy Trump and make him look bad. Borat too; had to become political. You can\\'t make this s**t up. Needless to Stay; not a single political scene is funny. Only when borat is being the old borat; free of \"wokeness\"; makes you laugh. I\\'m such a huge huge fan of borat...I can\\'t believe Sasha Baron Cohen did this to us. I mean...really Unforgivable. The guy is completly blind in his hate for Trump.Shame on you Sasha!Boy am i disappointed...,Pushes the boundaries and sometimes leaps over the line. But after the initial gut reaction I found myself in stitches. Haven\\'t laughed that hard in a while.Sends a message; tells a story; and somehow accomplishes both merged into one. The plot line makes you ask what could be possible and what is too absurd to be believable only to realize that every single event is exists.,Really dumb; their bad acting and fake gibberish language was not only lazy but annoying to my ears. Also it\\'s ironic he shows the video of Trump calling women hot; when I haven\\'t met a single straight man (even liberals and Hillary supporters) resist calling a woman hot or talking about women with desire. It\\'s human nature and any woman who thinks her boyfriend hasn\\'t objectified women is not only naive but probably a mentally impaired feminist.,What a dissapointment! You can only stretch a joke to a certain degree and then it becomes unbearable. This is just a rehash of old film but more daft and ridiculous. Unwatchable and totally avoidable. Watch the first film again instead; and it will be more enjoyable than this junk.,Cohen is amazing. He knows exactly how to build enough intrigue with these marks. He capitalises on their curiosity ultimately leading to their being the butt of the joke. And who can feel sorry for them When you\\'re laughing your behind off?The ending will make you smile.,Enjoyed every bit of it. Well written and nicely put together. SB cohen does it again!!,I loved the first one; and in generally SBH works. This one is too staged; not that funny. Disappointing.,There area few good laughs in this; the best being a dance. If you don\\'t like rednecks and southerners much; you will like this. Though I think they have been unfairly treated here; cherry picked you could say.Hard to tell who was real and who was acting in some cases.\\nThe actor playing his daughter did a good job.,9/10 - hysterical; timely; and quite revealing sequel to the 2006 original will certainly be one to look back on in a few years,Outstanding from start to finish; Maria Bakalova deserves an award; that girl has got crazy talent. Borot hasn\\'t missed a beat. When Americans do unbelievably stupid thing he\\'s there to just shine a mirror at them. Excellent work.,I think the humor of this film is not for everyone; but I think this is more than a comedy. Borat makes us see the reality of things thanks to the humor that he manages. Borat\\'s only \"bad\" is that at times it feels slow for the hour and a half that lasts. But I think Sacha Baron Cohen does a great job handling this mod.,I can\\'t even remember the last time I laughed so hard and as much as last night watching this one. SBC for the win!,I am baffled. Is the point of this movie franchise to embarrass people? Like a less funny or clever version of \"Nathan for You\"? It\\'s incredibly awkward and I found myself cringing the entire time. There is a great way to do awkward humor and this just made me feel bad for the people who were forced to interact with this incredibly annoying and ridiculous character. 2 stars because of production value,This was a really smart movie with many real hidden camera scenes. Very political; very liberal and very true.,Taking Borat to the now openly broken America 14 years later; Cohen skewers one piggish facet of American culture after another - ultimately cutting at some of Trumps top cronies. Pure genius meets comedic balls of steel.Watch.,I laughed the entire time. Not sure how he gets away with these stunts especially this time but this one hits home in a huge way. He manages to poke fun at everything that is wrong with America today and it was just brilliant. Loved it; 10/10!,Just bizarre.\\nCould be very funny but its just made of the bad parts.\\nThe daughter is just terrible.Democrat hollywood.,This movie seems so forced and it is not remotely clever or funny at all. It\\'s too bad some people have no respect for themselves or the things they create because in my opinion he is just raping the character to make a little more money.,All of us gathered around the TV were so psyched; so thrilled. Finally another Borat. We all agreed that expecting anything like the first one was probably unwise; but we all thought we would be astonished; yet again. Maybe in another way; maybe less this time; but still...When the movie ended there was a big silence. And then some \"humms\". We had all tried so hard; during the movie; to laugh. We were all trying so hard now to find something fun to talk about and laugh together about. Nothing. Just \"humm\".Complete and utter disappointment. Nothing fun; just political and .. dumb.,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is easily the funniest movie of 2020 and perhaps one of the funniest of all time. A product of its\\' time; the film takes what are now familiar themes of Sasha Baron Cohen and incorporates them into Borat\\'s familiar idiom. He takes you on long journey that ends in the present day with stops along the way to embarrass people left and right. He shows how strange our country has become and yet; it\\'s a familiar kind of strange. The plot is very clever. How he pulled such an amazing series of events together is baffling. They must have had to constantly adapt to new circumstances until they got the results that made the most sense. Oh; and it\\'s easily the funniest movie I\\'ve seen in many years. Maybe since the first Borat. I recommend it for the laughs even if you don\\'t agree with the sentiments. It\\'s that funny ...,Not good as the first movie; but i think thats normal. Many cringe and funny moments. i enjoyed it a lot,So it\\'s a bit of a culture mish-mash and that\\'s what makes it fun. I liked most of the jokes; it started off a little slow but got better; but overall it was fun the whole way though. My initial feelings...I was glad to have seen it; and I would probably watch it again. I would not say this is a family friendly movie; I don\\'t think a younger audience will really get a lot of the jokes; this is definitely meant for those who are part of the political environment which has been such a hot topic lately; and it does a very good job of capturing most of it. I did like the ending a lot; it has a bit of a twist I was not expecting at all which I thought was very impressive for such a film.,I wish good luck to Maria and hopefully she gets involved in many other movies. We need new faces and talent especially from eastern europe; because there is not many at the moment.,The original is still one of the funniest movies of the last 15 years. This one is different; more of a movie than a documentary. Borat is; still that loveable but non pc buffoon. The story between father and daughter is cringy but also heartwarming. Maria Buklova is a defo star in the making. Good but not great like the first.,Retread of same jokes from first movie. What is original isn\\'t funny.....at...all.Cohen appears to have jumped the shark.,Smh If there were 0 i would have gave it 0/0 this movie was so bad,Watch Sasha Baron in the Spy and you will wonder how that amazing actor produces such pure trash comedy like these movies. Sasha\\'s Boring\\'s comedy is not only not funny but is just pushing the media agenda on fake scandals which is already over played. Hope he makes another series like the spy before he gets hit by a bus. Not sure which I will enjoy more.,The movie reminds me of a Three Stooges episode brought forward in time and with an R rated theme. The movie rambles around in an attempt to expose social and moral hypocrisy and does so in a predictable manor. It would be a total waste of time but for the crescendo of \"exposing\" a leading political hypocrite; Rudy Giuliani. Rudy becomes the \"star\" of the movie because he is the only one who doesn\\'t understand that he is the principal \"Stooge\". Seeing him caught with his \"hand in the cookie jar\" provides the grand laugh of 2020.,This movie has more laugh out loud moments than 95% of all comedies in 2020.\\nWhether you\\'re right wing or left wing or whatever the hell; this is just funny. No it\\'s not the exact same as the first movie; but what were you expecting?,Humorous that Amazon; the massive tech empire under the recent attention by AOC and 3 for monopolistic business practices; threatened to be investigated and potentially broken apart; fans the left with more glory... feeding the youth with more anti American propaganda... attacks the right; which traditionally is more capitalistic and would favor Amazon. So you have a catch 22 here... attack the dog that feeds you to ultimately be destroyed by the left who you seem to love so dearly.As far as this \"film\"... borat returns; this time to go full force on one particular group of people in the US. What made the first film funny was that he just went after everyone.If ratings weren\\'t obvious enough guys... I don\\'t know what else will cause these loons to re-align. Go woke and go broke. However; the down votes come from the kids who think it\\'s cool still to rebel against society; wearing graphic tees; joggers and park ranger hats on Instagram. Or the others that paid 200g for degrees that ultimately mean nothing to society and expect everyone to pay for their mistakes.If I could rate this propaganda a 0 I would. And I\\'m not even the demographic attacked in this pathetic 1.5 hour waste of time. Not even gypsy tears can save this dump.,It\\'s not funny or clever. A narcissistic sociopath creating shock value moments. People who laugh at similar have moral and intellectual challenges that should be assessed for psychotherapy treatment. I feel sorry for his wife and children.,Just watch it...there will be butthurt people giving bad reviews; but the dark humor is just next level.,IM NOT VOTING FOR TRUMP ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE! THANKS BORAT,Sarcastically on point. Very well made movie during pandemic ; not as funny as borat 1 but serves its purpose with great humor.,The gags weren\\'t quite as outrageous as in the first film (which I consider a 10); and it was a bit slower-paced; and it felt more scripted; and once you\\'re familiar with the Borat process it loses some of its novelty. That being said; this movie is a solid comedy with plenty of chuckles and some great laugh-out-loud moments. If nothing else; it\\'s worth it just to watch a certain politician/lawyer be put in a very compromising situation toward the end of the movie. I recommend it.,I didn\\'t like the 1st Borat movie and only reason why I watch this one; is because my husband asked me to. I laughed though the whole film. My favorite personal favorites are the baby; the father and daughter dance; the bathroom scene at the convention; and the end with Rudy.Don\\'t know why people are hating on this. Honestly I expected this movie to really suck; because I really hated the first one. However I was really surprised; I laughed throughout the movie.Watch it!,In the scene where the girl is dancing with her period; you can see the blood on the floor disappear then re-appear in different shots. They likely filmed this scene in an empty room then cut it in to make it look like it was in front of an audience.This is the kind of misleading garbage that SBC has devolved to.The Giuliani scene had similar tricks and ended up being a huge letdown. He WAS clearly tucking his shirt back in; after the girl tugged it out when removing his mic.I also find it annoying that all the media outlets were reporting she was referred to being 15 years old through out the interview. Not once is \"15\" mentioned in the scene until after the bed shot when SBC bursts in and says she\\'s 15.Not a fan of the guy and it\\'s obvious what he\\'s thinking but it\\'s hardly some massive \"caught red handed\" moment they hyped it up to be.All in all SBC just looks like he\\'s doing a bad impersonation of Borat; and the whole joke of the film is supposed to be pointing out how crazy conservatives are. Which; by itself; is not funny.,For those who got mad over the movie; then they accomplished what they where aiming for.,It is funny and wild; but there is something missing. The first one was super funny because of the reactions of other people. This subsequent moviefilm has much less surprised or disgusted reactions. People are just so calm about what they see.,It is easy to see why people are offended by films such as these; however feel that is exactly the point. The content is meant to shock; its produced in a way that makes you question whether you\\'re a good or bad person for laughing. This is real satire. No individual in a position if power is safe from Sacha Baron Cohen; the man is a genius. Though weaker than the first film I still found myself laughing out loud at the majority of the film. Would fully recommend. Very nice!,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm like first part; was fairly amusing.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is same as first; brilliant.The movie starts slow but with time; movie becomes amazing and the ending was unexpected. It\\'s execution was better than the first one.There are no proper words to describe Cohen. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind.Overall; I would recommend everyone to watch and enjoy it.,It\\'s obvious that this movie wouldn\\'t live up to the original. There\\'s not nearly as much public skits because of how well-known the Borat name is nowadays; and it was those skits that made the original so big in the first place. Knowing that; Cohen tries to make up for it by focusing on a few bigger scenarios involving people in power unknowingly starring in the movie.I personally had a blast watching the spectacle unfold with the Borat character along with how the story weaves in current events in hilarious ways. The movie also has a much harder political edge than the first movie; which will make it a hard sell for some. It\\'s still more than worth the watch. Sacha Baron Cohen is still great as Borat and Maria Bakalova puts in a solid performance as well!,I loved the first movie and im not gonna lie; this is as close as it gets in these modern times. Its hard to fool people like Sacha and yet he still succeeds in many hilarious ways. Borats daughter Tutar is alot of fun; I laughed way to many times and her acting is brilliant. SHE FOOLED RUDY FFS AND almost got away with it. So it became \"extra\" brilliant to not just laugh at Sacha; but to her aswell with hilarious punch lines and good executed comments togheter with her father.I can\\'t help it to feel bad for all the people in this movie tho. Im not from America so I can\\'t comment on their political status (more than I\\'ve read from the news in Sweden). But still I guess they got what they deserved. For me watching the movie from another country without any knowledge about America was a joyfull but frightening experience. Especially the scenes with Judith the jew. I heard that she passed away (may she rest in piece) and that her daughter actually sued Sacha for making the film and was demanding that they removed the scene with her from the movie. I understand that to 100% but still. Probably the most beautiful part of the movie that Judith actually accepted Borat for being a jerk; giving him a hug and saying the word \"hope\".I truly think this is a masterpiece in all ways. You can seperate the scenes from reality and still stay very close to the content of this film. What an absolute blast it was but I must admit; many of the scenes where very very very immature. Like the sequence at the prom/ball with all the daughter and fathers. I wish I could see the aftermath from that building but it skipped to the next part directly. It portayed America and the Donald Trump followers like complete idiots but still with balls of still managed to live among them and speak to them as they respected Borat.GREAT ACTING - VERY VERY FUNNY - SACHA EXPOSED EVIL TO THE TRUTH - MADE AMERICA LOOK STUPID AGAIN*CHENGUI Sacha; I sincerelly hope that I will meet you someday.^thank you???,Go woke; go broke. A piece of unfunny and scatological cliches; lazy and lame political propaganda. Shame on you Amazon.,Remember when Borat made fun of everyone?\\nThere was a few laughable moments; but was not at all what I was hoping for.\\nWas expecting a more unbiased comedy poking at everyone.\\nJust another example of one sided film making; heavily disappointed.,Got to hand it to Sacha Baron Cohen; this is a remarkable feat. Okay; so in a few places there\\'s some staging but a lot of it is clearly filmed straight; fooling people into revealing some jaw-dropping stances.It\\'s cringe-making in many places at an almost unwatchable level but only because it\\'s so funny.What makes me award this 10 stars is that it\\'s very brave to have made this in 2020 in the run-up to the elections and in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. A number of the pranks put Sacha\\'s life on the line.My only reservation is the moment in the synagogue but; wow; those ladies came out of it beautifully.Full marks to Maria Bakolova who plays the daughter brilliantly.,Sacha Baron Cohen back doing what he does best!\\nThis guy is in a league of he\\'s own. While a lot more of this Sequel is scripted; due to Borats high profile; these scenes are more for plot development and build up to the real scenes with the aim of people exposing themselves. For me; the three standout scenes that showcase this were; the abortion clinic; the final interview; and the ball. The daughters reaction to her father offering a large sum of money in exchange for Borat\\'s daughter was priceless; and the fact it was so genuine made it 10x funnier.\\nThe way the film ties in with current events but is also not constantly about covid is done extremely well and creates a great story line.\\nIn my opinion this film is just as hillairous as the original; but just at a less frequently; but is made up for with the better plot and conclusion.A special mention to the supporting actress who seems relatively unknown; but gave an exceptional performance. I definitely expect to be seeing more of her in future films. And of course Sacha the GOAT never disappoints!,Even better than the previous movie!!!!\\nSimply wonderful!,I compare the first one to Jackass. A bunch of cringeworthy segments; but this one had a plot tied into the cringeworthy segments. Maria Bakalova has balls of steel to keep up with the master Sasha Baron Cohen. She was more than delightful and mega comedy chops. The storyline which I didn\\'t put much thought into at first turned out to tie it all together in a great way. Worth the time and I will watch it again tomorrow.,Thank you so much for the greatness; both of you. Yugoslavian from cold preBrexit England admire your work; don\\'t settle down guys! Romani!,Excellent; not quite as funny as the first; but a better balance of cringe factor; first is still so hard to watch without muting the volume every now and then. Super relevant. Gonna be a few more lawsuits I think 😂,Would\\'ve given 7 stars but have to balance overall rating damage from people giving 1 star.,The most disturbing movie I have ever seen; to picture women to be treated like cows in a neglected barn in some countries.\\nThis is not discussing a case; because there is no such case even in some conservative countries towards women rights; there is no example like what the movie pictures with all of that disturbing exaggeration.\\nThose disturbing scenes I saw were covering comedy with sadness.\\nThis one is sad to be even evaluated.,This is a very entertaining and enlightening movie; sad but unsurprising views from right wing nuts,If this is the way ; they think ; they are going to beat Trump ; they are so wrong ! RUBISH won\\'t make it .,Absolute trash and not funny just like the first one. I don\\'t understand how or why anybody finds this funny. Do yourself a favor and skip it.,Tired jokes and the shock value has waned somewhat.Basically; it\\'s a political agenda movie. I think this is another tired excuse to play an increasingly overplayed game.Watch it if you\\'re a die hard Borat fan; it does have a few decent laughs. The cringe factor is based more on the lecture messaging; than the gags.Cohen is a great comedy actor and I\\'m sure there is better to come from him soon...,I am a big fan of Sacha and I think he is on the right side of history but this movie is lazy compared to the genius of the original. The jokes aren\\'t funny. The fake interviews aren\\'t shocking. Maybe it\\'s just that nothing is new under the sun in the age of social media - or maybe it\\'s just because the film is flat; lazy; and stupid. The daughter character is a disaster. The stuff dealing with the Republicans is worth watching however.,Without Borat\\'s daughter in this film I believe that it would\\'ve failed. She was fantastic and she made the movie her own! She was absolutely amazing!!!,Sasha is a genius; so so funny!\\nActress playing Borats daughter is brilliant!!!,Jagshemash! This mockumentary once again centers around Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev; a naïve misogynistic; racist; anti-Semitic stranger to American culture (Sacha Baron Cohen). While not as controversial shocking nor funny as the original. This Amazon Studios Video on Demand sequel directed by Jason Woliner deserved a high five for having more heart than the 2006 flick. While focusing on Borat\\'s relationship with his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) on her arranged marriage to a top US politician can get annoying at times especially with the actress use of a heavy Bulgarian accent loud over nagging voice. I found the chemistry between them generally moving. Good acting. Both individuals do grow more likeable as the film goes on and into better people. It\\'s so unlike the first movie where the individuals mostly stay the same. Nevertheless; I didn\\'t like what the filmmakers did with original supporting characters like Azamat (Ken Davitian) & Luenell (Luenell Campbell). I get that the performers had pay disputes; but their characters should be written off the film a little better than what we got. Still the sequel does a good job acknowledges its predecessor\\'s success as well as the gap between movies; by explaining in universe that the first film made Kazakhstan into a laughing stock in the national stage. Thus; the government punish Borat for over a decade until he was given another chance with this sequel. Nevertheless; the guerrilla prank style filmmaking kinda has wine down since 2006; as the character\\'s image has become way too popular. Cohen even had to retired Borat at one time due to being unable to fool unaware real people to gain access to their genuine\\' s reactions toward solecism for laughs. In order to make the movie work; Sacha had to put Borat under heavy makeup and new disguises or give comedic trolling the crowd scenarios to Tutar. Because of that; there is very few scenes of Borat dress in his traditional suit and acting like himself; which is a shame. To add onto that; the people that he does interacted with; seem more in with the joke than the other movie. I\\'m not saying that they were paid performers; but I doubt that conspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell would allow a man with a filmmaking crew to stay with them for five whole days without noticing something odd during a pandemic. Bits like them going to find Tutar at a rally seem heavily rehearsed. The same can be said with Jeanise Jones who drives her to the clinic and gives a bizarre; but inspiriting semi long speech to Borat\\'s daughter about womanhood. It\\'s really hard to believe that these people didn\\'t know that it was a work. The only confirm person that I can tell that was in with the joke was Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Her story was so charming that Cohen broke character. Sadly; the film\\'s creators still got sued for fraud when her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that Judith did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness despite otherwise. Surprisingly unlike the first movie that result in many legal actions by participants ranging from individuals to whole cities. This one had little. Still; as of this writing; it is too early to tell. After all politicians like Rudy Giuliani might sued over allegations of impropriety. The actress did kinda led him on. Regardless the country of Kazakhstan will probably continue to hate their backwater racism portrayal in these films. Some Kazakhstanis really wanted this film to be canceled. I doubt that they would be happy with the twist ending involving the coronavirus. Still it makes me wonder what was the original climax if the pandemic never did hit during the production of this movie. I can see it being much more grandeur. COVID-19 really did good a number on the flick as the banning of large gatherings meant less events for Borat to crash into. While Cohen was indeed lucky to gain access to one of the Republicans key conferences. He didn\\'t get the reaction that he was looking for with Donald Trump like he got with Ali G with the ice cream glove business skit. It\\'s a shame that the scenes with Trump got cut from the final version. As for the sequence with Mike Pence. That interaction wasn\\'t as impressed in real life. Unlike the film with the long pause; Pence just continue his speech as if they weren\\'t any disruption. Cohen was quickly escort out of the building. Unlike the first Borat flick; in which the actor was famously arrested nearly 100 times and follow by the FBI. He felt that he risked his livable more making this movie due to the harsh political unrest that came with the pandemic. Cohen even said there were two separate occasions in which he had to wear a bulletproof vest. It\\'s safe to say that the rightwing rally where Borat sang an offensive song was probably one of them. While that song was somewhat catchy. It was still disturbing to see some people cheer him on. It reminds me so much of the \\'Peace\\' episode of the Da Ali G Show when Borat sang a similar tune. While I do like that Cohen mocked their echo chamber attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak for all it\\'s worth. I just wished they didn\\'t recycle the same types of the pranks that you can see on one of his old show. It made some of the sequences somewhat tiresome. Meanwhile others felt disconnected and uncompleted like the random barbershop gag. Regardless; the humor in this is probably better than what Cohen plan in the unauthorized sequel called \\'My Brother\\' starring Borat\\'s mentally-challenged brother Bilo. The cringe factor in that version would be too much to handle. Overall: Dziekuje Cohen for making the right decision. In the end; while the movie is not as good as the original. It\\'s still worth skipping sexy time to check out. A must watch.,I haven\\'t laughed so hard or have been so shocked so hard in such a long time. This movie brought to light the ugliness of the rising Fascism in the US in a comedic fashion.,It\\'s brilliant. No matter how much he tries to shock and be the crazy one in the end it always shows how the \"normal\" citizens are often much more bizarre and surreal in their own behaviour. Maria who plays the daughter deserves an Oscar for her outstanding performance. Very proud that she\\'s a Bulgarian. Over all I\\'m pleasantly surprised by the sequal because usually the 2nd never equals the first movies but this time I can whole heartily say Borat 2 is amazing and everyone needs to see it. We sure could use some more laughs in life and this movie definitely provides us with laughter but also a deeper view on how ridiculous everything is happening just in front of us.,The film certainly has its moments. Obviously it\\'s from a liberal standpoint there\\'s no attempt made to present both viewpoints; any more than there is in a Michael Moore movie. There are certainly funny moments but it\\'s not nearly as outrageous as the original. And there is some hearts in this movie as a relationship between the two protagonists grows. The part with Rudolph Giuliani is way overblown. The only person I saw touching knees was her touching him. He pats her lightly on the back not the rear end and to me it looked much more fatherly than lecherous. She made every attempt in removing his sound equipment and coaxing him into the bedroom to make him look foolish and it failed. He was simply tucking in his pants. Much ado about nothing his treatment of her was fatherly not lecherous. Since I already pay for Amazon Prime it was worth the price of admission I wouldn\\'t pay to see this at a movie theater,This was quite brilliant. America is the laughing stock. Are we not awake yet? 4 years and we\\'re still chanting \"make America great again\"? Borat showed the ugliness in power; money and politics. But we haven\\'t gotten anywhere with human trafficking which is an issue right before our very eyes daily?!? America. Wake. Up!,The movie is very disappointing. Differently from the first one; with several jokes and making funny of all; this one has an agenda and focus on politics with mostly anti-Trump. In addition; it made me laugh just a couple of times.,I loved Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. His newest film did not have the same feel; more staged than his previous film. The political aspect of the movie was humorous but we will have to see if it ages well over the years when everything dies down.,Boring..\\nDisrespectful to countries and any human... I liked all previous movies from Sasha... Not this one.. Hope best for him..,Terrible movie that makes you cringe. The whole premise using his \"daughter\" to meet Pence is just creepy; cringy; Keeping her in a cage bit is just sleazy. Even if you hate Trump this movie sucks.,The man\\'s a genius and a great comic mind. Brilliant,If you expect fun; then yes. There is one funny moment right at the beginnning. After that you just wait and wait .... and yawn. The only reason Cohen created this mess was Trump and elections. The film lacks everything. I also think that Cohen should finally come out of his closet. He loves men\\'s genitals way too much.,Wow.. this took nerves of steel to make! So crazy!,This rating is primarily because I LOVE how the film reveals the horrible stupidity that is behind this U.S. president; his political party; and his supporters. Of course; Texas and Oklahoma feature prominently in this! It\\'s also because I laughed quite a bit; mostly at the above stupid people. The addition of Borat\\'s daughter works well! The only thing I noticed; for me; is that the shock value from the first movie wasn\\'t in this one. I guess after 4 years of 45\\'s racist; misogynist; anti-American tweets and mumblings; I\\'ve grown accustomed to that party\\'s lies and rhetoric. Sad.As a side note; the Rudy Giuliani piece is horribly disturbing. Again; sadly not surprising; but horribly disgusting. I hope he; and his president; end up in jail. Or in a Kazakhstan gulag for life! Or stuffed into a wooden box with Kazakh Minister of Culture and top pornstar; Johnny the Monkey! Any of the 3 would suffice...,Extremely well done in an election year with the current pandemic. And absolute amazing farce with a well tied together story. Hilarious!,Absolutely hilarious! I loved it. Especially the Rudi scene.,Sacha Baron Cohen finds an actor with a comedic genius like his and the hysterical fun is now further through the roof! However; there were more scenes in this sequel that made me question how improvised they really were and whether the real people were in on the outrageous stuff happening around them; and there appears to be much more editing of these scenes. So the first movie definitely remains on the top.,Because of the cancel culture and the need to please all audiences; nowadays there are increasingly rare satire films that test the limits of humor. Borat achieved that; not skimping on dark humor; nonsense and sarcasm.,This movie had me belly laughing. It really brings to light how people think America is and how America actually is.,Wow!Sacha Baron Cohen doesn\\'t disappoint!WATCHING NOW FOR THR SECOND TIME AS I JUST GOT DONE WITH THR 1st WATCH!Will write more soon...but Rudy is totally eff\\'d!,I LAUGHED OUT LOUD!!!! honestly I do believe it was just as equally funny as the 1st movie in fact maybe even funnier because they implemented current events and we all know this year has been hella wack with Covid and all the political bs lol so In a way it was refreshing to see it all play out in a funny way through through this movie.,Sacha Baron Cohen and the makers of this moviefilm deserve a ton of credit for actually filming most of the scenes included here. Some of them are so over the top and insane you won\\'t believe they\\'re real. Borat is often hilarious and had me chuckling throughout most of the film. I think the beginning is the strongest; however the ending is pretty good. The plot is better than you would expect and the movie pushes it along fairly well. This movie likely won\\'t age as well as the first one though given how focused on current events it is.It\\'s essentially a piece of propaganda for the upcoming election; but that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t funny.,Too many low reviews from the offended - I liiiike . Did well after being so well known but then I suppose if there\\'s one place that has so many gullible folk with their heads stuck where there\\'s no sun,One of my favorite scenes was Cohen; wearing a Klan getup; running through a crowded conservative Republican event featuring VP Pence. Cohen shouts: \"I\\'m Stephen Miller.\" \"Let me through; I\\'m Stephen Miller.\"The setups of situations exposing misogyny and gender stereotypes were brilliant. The Guiliani segment was priceless; as was the Qanon brothers expose.Cohen did an amazing job of getting this film wrapped and ready for presentation just before the election. Hats off to production staff; makeup; set decoration; director; and actors. Loved it.,Usually I don\\'t like stupid or under the belt humor... And I even avoid crude humor... but... Well it may be even offensive... but...\\nBut even if Borat may be one of the most recent \"dumb films\"; it\\'s loaded with some accurate truth; politically incorrect maybe (maybe correct too much?); and addressing issues nobody would like to talk about (or does); which describes our society today; without hiding behind a false \"reality\" ; including during an epidemic. Wait for the ending! It\\'s political? Hell yes. Is it fun? Hell yes. (At least for the open minded).\\nYou don\\'t care about politics? Hell yes!\\nI Move to Kazakhstan!,Rudy\\'s hand in his pants was the least of his problems. His lies about coronavirus are as blatant as Trump\\'s.,If you liked the first one and thought it was funny; you\\'ll feel the same about this one. Any poor reviews are simply offended Trumpers.,I haven\\'t laughed that much in a long time. That was great!,Fantastic movie! Can\\'t wait to see it again. The ending was absolute genius. I wonder how many idiots will actually believe it?? Borat 3 please ASAP!!,This film (like the other one) is a satirical film on republicans people; so if you are one of them; and you have sense of humor; watch it; but if is not like that I think you will be triggered. 😊\\nPS: smile tomorrow could be to late.,Just like the majority of all sequels this pales in comparison to the first Borat film. The first Borat was near genius and incredibly funny but even Borat points out that he is too recognisable to pull the story off one more time. Hence a lot of the so called \\'real people\\' feel like actors or people who are just going along with the joke. Yes it certainly not the fault of Cohen that his film was so successful he can no longer get away with it; but perhaps it\\'s a shortfall in thinking that it was worth going for a second shot. It just felt a little desperate and also rushed; too focussed on what they thought was a gigantic satirical opportunity; that being 2020; the year from hell. Yes they were right; grab the bull by the horns but the bull had already dashed unfortunately. Nice try Sascha but no gold medal; maybe a bronze if you are lucky.,Twice! Seriously; I was laughing so hard that I couldn\\'t hold it in. The jokes won\\'t land for about 43% of the United States. But for the 53% on the right; or should I say left side; this will be hilarious.If you are tempted to down vote my review at this point; then this movie definitely is not for you. I encourage everyone else to to watch. The plot is somewhat slow but the comedy more than makes up for it.I owned and watched the original many times and I will watch this again. I\\'m frequently on my phone or working on my computer while watching TV or movies; but my phone stayed in my pocket the entire time. I believe that is as much a testament as dumptrump and Borat fans need.,Wow! There\\'s too much content here to properly synthesize this film; i\\'m flustered. It\\'s just too damn funny. Beyond the obvious political agenda and glaringly satirical overtones; Cohen has reproduced the *perfect* comedy for all personality types...mature personality types...so long as one refuses to get caught up in the sarcastic details. Not to mention the whole idea is to comfort all those who feel \"lost\" in these uncertain and unfamiliar times. Borat; once again; reminds us that once we stop caring about the societies overwhelming idiosyncrasies; we can all live in social harmony. Yes; i will admit some of the themes felt...forced. Being where we are as a race; i still believe this is a very strong and relevant work of art. Absolutely hilarious. I have left spoilers out so your first viewing experience can be a...hmmm...what\\'s the phrase....ah right....great success!,Best comedy made after Borat 1. If you don\\'t like this movie you have no sence of humour. Great Success Sacha Baron Cohen.,I loved the first Borat but this was awful; a movie made to help skew and election when most people watch movies to remove themselves from everyday life and the dominant election.What a waste of 2+ hours; I would say \\'that\\'s two hours I\\'m never getting back\\' but fortunately our clocks went back so I got 1 hour back.Movie wasn\\'t funny; SBC obviously has issues; the movie was about selling an underaged girl who is getting implants so he needs to get his head checked because that\\'s not comedy.Just rewatch the original.,Absolutely disgusting film; so oppressive towards women. No wonder the male-female authority still exists of films like this are being made. There is no funny element about this film; and I am shocked that in 2020 films like this are still allowed to be made.,I no longer go into watching a film with high or low expectations. I go in subjectively. SBC has never been even remotely funny. I watched the first one to see how stupid a suprising majority of U.S. citizens were in respects to the unfunny; crude,\"Finally a good sequel; i think this is a better then the first one; it\\'s more interesting; more funny; and of course more shocking; this sequel proof Sacha Baron Cohen acting skill after 14 years not to be Borat character and his acting is still awesome; not less but better; i highly recommend; but make sure watch the first one first\",Finally someone has the guts to show how sad this country has become and make us laugh while doing it. Not an easy thing to do.,You really have to wonder how this film came together; especially with some of the scenes at the end. Mind you; I guess they really did roll with the times quite well; because I suspect that as things changed dramatically around March 2020 they had to completely rework the script at the last minute; but then again CoVid really did take the world by surprised (not that we didn\\'t see anything like this coming; it is just that we basically live in our own little bubbles; and don\\'t expect things that happen on the other side of the world to really affect us all that much).Look; I\\'ve never been a particularly big fan of Cohen; and I wasn\\'t a particularly big fan of his first film; but a part of me wanted to see this film; even if it was because I was captivated by the trailer. It turned out to actually be pretty good; and surprisingly I found myself bursting out in laughter numerous times during the film. However; the thing that I thought was great was how the film simply seemed to roll with the times; especially since halfway through we have Borat wandering around the empty streets wandering where everybody has gone (and ends up shacking up with some conservatives for five days).Actually; that scene was pretty cool; because while on one hand there is the suggestion that he was mocking their beliefs; he was also demonstrating to us that they are actually nice guys. The fact that they let this guy stay with them for five days; and didn\\'t get upset despite some of the really weird things that he was doing; and even went as far as to point out that his book was wrong; really does go to show that these people aren\\'t actually the monsters that some people make them out to be.Mind you; the end scene is an absolute classic; and as Cohen indicates; we really should make up our mind as to what was really going on. It was quite funny though that the person that the joke was a target of thought that he had out played Cohen; without actually realising what was actually going on. Of course; once the film was released you can imagine that this person has immediately gone into damage control.I guess one of the problems with a film like this is that you aren\\'t going to get the real reactions that you would if it wasn\\'t being recorded; though I understand that Cohen does get into these things by pretending to be somebody completely different. However; the rather deadpan faces that you get with some of the scenes; such as in the family planning clinic and in the hardware store; as well as in the store with the fax machine; does suggest that while it was odd; it was not something that was really going to raise concerns (which no doubt would have had a completely different result if; say; they were using hidden cameras in the clinic).I tell you what though; Maria Bakalova was absolutely outstanding in this film; and she just falls into the role so well. The other thing is the way that they use language - like; I have no idea what they are speaking; and it certainly sounds as if they are communicating with each other; despite the fact that Bakalova is speaking Bulgarian; and Cohen is speaking Hebrew Gibberish (I\\'m not even sure if that is actually a language). Yet; they do it so well; and it comes across so authentic; despite the fact that it is all a put on.Yeah; this is actually a pretty cool film; and I must say that I really did enjoy it; even though it does make you feel uncomfortable in parts. Personally; I wouldn\\'t necessarily call it eye opening; and I doubt that it is going to change the election all that much; but it was still a pretty good watch. Oh; and I did quite like the bit at the beginning where he actually played up the fact that he can\\'t really walk around dressed as Borat anymore.,Though; not nearly as funny as the first film ; and several \"gasp worthy\" scenes short as the previous; this was a great way to appease the Borat in us all. Yeah; the political rhetoric is obviously Anti-Trump; but hey; it\\'s 2020 and everyone is pissed off at something. I found a few moments that sparked a laugh; and generally entertaining throughout. But what can Cohen do? Kids; senior citizens and everyone between know of Borat. It\\'s not like he can hide anywhere! The costumes were a great addition!\\nSuper curious how many Civil suits the production company and Cohen get hit with... but I\\'d watch this again!! Give it a whirl!!,This movie is filled with propagranda and it\\'s not funny in the slightest.,There is a reason certain people are angered by this film. It shows the stuff they are willing to put up with. Funny and truthful!,Tackles all social issues going on in this world with great humour;sometimes uncomfortable but that is what Mr.Cohen does best.Timing of this movie is perfect and a great time for bringing Borat back and laugh at the sad state of affairs that we are in.,Had to make an account on here just for this movie. It was hilarious in its typical fashion and anyone saying it was all staged hasn\\'t done their research. He truly did impede on the February Michael Pence CPAC. The scenes with Rudy were legit; amongst some others yet to be told. I\\'m rating a 10 just in hopes of countering butthurt Trump fans that are rating it poorly.,I guess we know what Sasha Baron Cohen has been doing while in quarantine!!\\nI think I\\'ll just make a possibly large budget; multi national film at the drop of a hat. Now that is power my friend!\\nVery current! Much better than the previous ones.\\nI could see a lot of growth and I think more of Sasha Baron Cohen; the man and artist; in this movie.\\nIt dealt with so many different current issues and beliefs and was not really political because he poked fun at and exposed all sides.\\nMostly he exposed the inappropriateness of us not getting along with one another in the USA.\\nI think I have described my take on the movie without giving away any specifics.\\nIt is silly; so know that up front.\\nIf you feel offended; wait 2 minutes and you will be laughing as he lands on another subject.\\nHis sidekick in the movie was a great find! Casting miracle! Lucky!,The first Borat movie was basically a documentary of him just going around town saying racist and sexist things. but in this new movie; it is basically more of a movie than a documentary. It centers around Borat trying to get his daughter pretty to be able to marry someone. and that\\'s basically the whole story. the reason I think this is a movie more than a documentary is because it focuses around Love and family; and how Borat finds true love for his daughter rather than needing to. there were a few funny things from this movie but there\\'s no way that it could be funnier than the first one. If it were; there would actually be execution\\'s towards them. the first film was way more racist and sexist. while this movie focused on being pretty much just sexist material because race is a harder thing nowadays. I thought it was entertaining Irina Nowak really shined and basically took the mantel for being the female version of Borat. Funny; racist; sexist. you know... all that good stuff. its definitely a good movie with some good jokes in it so if you like the first one; you should at least check this one out.,Not as funny as the original but this film has less skits and more story; probably because Borat is too recognizable. It\\'s more like 7/10 but gave it a 10 to balance out the Republican snowflakes.,Sums up the whole story as republicans vs science; if you didn\\'t like this movie then you\\'re probably one of the guys that attended the rally,Very Nice; Great Success. This movie bring glory to Kazakhstan.,The movie is too childish; but very offensive. I made it to 18 minutes. The scene at this point was too much for me.That would be fine if the movie was funny like the first Borat movie; but this one is just awfull and not funny at all.,Terrible; offensive and not funny... waste of time!,The five minutes of humiliating Crazy Rudy was great (which is why I\\'m giving this great gobbling turkey as many as two stars) but I\\'m actually angry about the other hour-and-a-half when I could\\'ve been doing something worthwhile. Like sleeping. If you haven\\'t seen it yet the Giuliani snippet is very near the end. You don\\'t need the rest of it.,Just not funny. Don\\'t waste your time. He tries to set people up but it\\'s just not funny anymore,Just as good as the first one. And it was refreshing comedy; and a good take on the current social climate,Sacha Cohen is a true gem and this film proves it. To film this (secretly) during a pandemic was a superb achievement and risky. Borat unmasks some of the illnesses of society with his wit and solid preparation. This film is incredibly vulgar; inappropriate; politically incorrect; offensive and hilarious and so much needed during times like these.,Relevant to current scenario and entertaining at the same time.,Wait how can it be Borat when it was Randy Marsh??,I laughed so much but so much. This film is one of the best in 2020. if someone says it\\'s bad; don\\'t believe it. There must be some group criticized by the film.,Very nice. I like. This movie will bring back pride to glourious nation of Kasahstan.,I\\'m generally not a comedy guy. I did see the first Borat and found it to be a hodge-podge of prank sketches with some very funny gags.Sacha Baron Cohan\\'s follow-up improves over the original with a more story-based approach that still upends the \\'-isms\" in America (racism; sexism; etc.) in the midst of a freaking pandemic. It couldn\\'t be more well-timed in this brutal election season.The standout is Borat\\'s 15 year old daughter played by Maria Bakalova (she\\'s actually 24) who steals the show with her cluelessness and likeability.How well you enjoy this movie will depend on your own level of political ideology and tolerance to very crude and crass behavior. Personally; I found it hilarious. But it is definitely not for everybody.,Sacha Baron Cohen is a brilliant comedien- the problem he has found after the first Borat and Bruno was his fame made it more difficult for him to prank people- which is itself satirized in the movie.Borat remains a clever creation; but for me the best and most cringe inducing scenes featured Maria Bakalova- a natural comic actress who excels in some genuinely shocking scenes (Rudi Guliani in a bedroom.....). I suspect this film will be remembered as her debut in future years. Good to see Borat back; but a star is truly born as well- I suspect she will become a big star after this.,I\\'m from the U.K. I\\'d like to see a film-maker from Kazakhstan lampooning us. They would do it very well and with more wit. But evidently they have too much class.There were some funny moments in this film; but it was mostly lame and boringly lewd at times.It also copied Sarah Cooper (who is infinitely more entertaining) with the Usual Suspects bit.,It\\'s too bad that he\\'s more relevant than ever. That said; I dont think QAnon or the Obamagate people\\'s mind\\'s will be changed; but hopefully it helped show some people how ridiculous our action\\'s look online.I thought it was pretty good; for just being an updated version (with a female lead!) of the first movie. It\\'s funny how quickly people forget embarassment and let their guard\\'s down and get fooled again.Objectively (IMO) not as good as We Are America but better than Borat 1; though I don\\'t see why it would be as successful; the shock and awe is gone. We all feel how we feel about Trump and I don\\'t think this movie is going to motivate anyone on the other side of it\\'s Aisle.,Most sequels are boring re-hashes of their original and better works Borat 2 is as good as the original and builds on the themes of stupidity that The first film delved into. Well done SBC,Borat is back; but the first movie was better and more hilarious,Borat is back; and his second film does as much as can be done with the character in 2020. He is accompanied by his daughter Tutar who does a fine job of adding to the wacky comedy. The first half is still as great as the original but it declines as it\\'s clear that their plans have fallen through and they have to desperately improvise. It is also let down by being too scripted. Overall; a fine achievement that adds a lot to the original film but does not reach its heights in the end.,I\\'ll be quite honest although there was quite funny scenes but with borat there was to little what you see in trailer some of it you wouldn\\'t see like borat movie daughter went up to the roof of the car and the police talked to borat that never happened in the actual movie so that was disappointing when they say borat is number 4 and tutar is number 3 is so stupid like she wasn\\'t all that funny it felt like a tutar movie then a borat movie it shows trump right hand man almost having sex with her and she was 15 years old so there is some exposure when it comes to politics we saw more Tutar then borat it felt like kinda staged and at the end Tutar wearing a borat suit and having a boy\\'s haircut felt like she was immating being a man truly a feminist lesbian borat film and why kill of asamat batatov and it was kinda offensive to coronavirus victims saying borat caused the virus so obviously this film was shot before coronavirus and when coronavirus started it shows more of her then borat quite a disappointment I understand rules have changed but you still could of made it into a better film it kinder changed borat personality now he allows women equality it felt like a woke film to me but there was funny scenes and they had 12 more mins then the original and still showed less of borat it\\'s not a bad film but not great either,I fell on the floor laughing in the first Borat film where Borat and Azamat are naked in the elevator. The whole thing was funny. This time not so much. The dialogue between Borat and his daughter was so frustrating. Him speaking in Hebrew and her answering in Bulgarian for minutes at a time. Getting a fax machine employee to send stupid messages where the guy is clearly smirking at this was just not funny. The Trump hate was clearly in line with the host of late night talk shows and very mundane and repetitive. We get it the media hates him and would rather have you vote for anyone else. Cohen\\'s strength is his subtlety and mastery of language; the ability to twist words. He did not have an opportunity here due to his recognizable face in any outfit. The result is gibberish conversation in two different languages that has no meaning.,I\\'m a massive fan of the original and this film too deserves a watch; however it loses its edge and appeal as everyone knows who he is and it\\'s the stupidity of the public that makes the film work .. Cohen appears to be doing an impression of Borat; the voice is even different,People think this guy is a genius? Showing a man\\'s behind; strap on penises etc. is not comedy. That\\'s stuff that 10 year olds laugh about. What\\'s next? Fart jokes? Even the poster photo looks like trying too hard to make people who want to laugh laugh.,Couldn\\'t give it a 0 rating. Orange Man Bad. Why orange man so bad?,I was a huge fan of the first one. This one misses the mark. It\\'s crude; goes too much for shock. It wasn\\'t funny I actually was bored in it. Really have no idea how it is currently rated a 7 it\\'s nowhere near that.,Worst movie ever; right next to \"It\\'s Pat\". Epic fail on trying to gaslight negative situations on the republican party right before the election. A poor example of what the left thinks humor is.....we\\'ve seen so much better from Cohen....we need more humor; and less garbage politicking...shameful,Outstanding performance by the Bulgarian actress !!!\\nBe a good LAD and please sing\\n\\'\\'Boyko Borisov PEDERAS PEDERAS\\'\\'\\nwhen you\\'re accepting that oscar !\\nBe the Tutar all bulgarians would be proud of !love; Bristol,The thesis of both Borat movies is that Americans are generally willing to put up with far too much to avoid rocking the boat; and that this is dangerous.,Maybe not the best story ever but all the stupid things in it will make the ride funny.. I laughed my ass off in a few parts.. if you are a fan of borat you will like,Amazing; not as good as the original one. Still a 9/10.,We could all use some humor these days. This is a must watch. It is simply remarkable the way he is able to trick ordinary people.,Just a political; election year; rushed; poor movie. Sasha is such a smart guy; who made some awesome movies but this one is by far the worst. It\\'s just anti Republican smear movie; it got no other punch lines. with all political stuff this year; this movie just piles on more on top. If you are die hard democrat you will love the movie; if you non political or republican then this movie is just sad. Sasha can do much better then this.,This is a huge disappoinment. The first part was funny and fresh; while this is just disgusting. Turned it off after 33 minutes. Also the film is so dark you can\\'t see much most of the time. This sequel is a disgrace! Do not waste your time on it.,Not funny and fake. This isn\\'t a comedy; it\\'s a juvenile political attack job; and I\\'m not even American. The stereotypical character portrayals are not believable unless you\\'re a simple minded twit. What a waste of time!,Barely anything form the original Borat film was showcased here. What remains is a political propaganda piece designed to smear Republicans and only Republicans. How much can one sell out? Sasha\\'s career dies here.,Just a disgusting vile film. Humor for a 12 yr old boy. Degrading to women,I was expecting some good laughs from this film. All I get is a film that feels very staged for the most part. This movie feels very politically motivated where they attack one side and not the other. An extreme disappoint.,Very funny and outrageous until it stopped being funny. Turned out to be another opinion of a far left Hollywood celebrity. Too outrageous until it became much too much. I\\'ll pass on the next Sasha film.,Not over the top when you see what is being exposed in American life. Wow. The best satire on film since Dr. Strangelove.,After 14 years we received an irreverent sequel at the height of the first. It is true that it does not surpass the original but the songs it deals with and the way it does it will always have the stamp of Cohen as borat and that is more than enough to be happy with this new installment.,Just wow. Incredible; this was a mirror shown to the American society. What in the world happened to the USA?,I am mostly sorry I spent my time watching this.\\nThe first Borat film was a satire and had funny moments but this one is just cheap radical propaganda.\\nIt is clear that in every society one can find problematic groups or individuals.\\nSacha Baron Cohen decided to be the poster boy of the Democratic Party by feeding the viewers conspiracy lies about the Republicans.\\nIn one word - PRIMITIVE!\\nAnd actually really not funny.,Cant stop laughing sorry.\\nThis is artistically morbid\\nShocking depraving gore but at least it shows how sick is the society nowadays,I loved the first one and this doesn\\'t disappoint. I\\'m very much right wing so I don\\'t get the republicans getting upset learn to laugh at yourself. If you\\'re easily offended and have no sense of humour no you won\\'t like it. If you\\'re blessed with a sense of humour; can laugh at yourself you will love it. Baron Cohen deserves credit for how brave he is he genuinely puts his life on the line. Plus his on screen daughter is a delight.,I was expecting more given the hype. It was basically a 90 minute slow build up to a pretty anti-climactic scene with Rudy Giuliani.,And that was disappointing because to be fair prior to an election parts were removed so it would not be banned by \\'you know who\\'. The Guiliani embarassment is there but I assume the trump skit was left out due to political pressure.,Trust me when I say that I\\'ve watched *many* movies this year; given the current situation; and this I regret every minute of watching this movie. I think I\\'ve gotten more laughs from a nature documentary. This is movie is pretty mind-numbing and boring.Go watch a recent Adam Sandler movie if you want more laughs; and don\\'t bother with this steaming pile of garbage.,I loved Ali G; Borat; even The Dictator. But this is hot garbage. Cohen is just pandering to the lowest common denominator for cheap laughs; and regularly misses the mark. Deceptive editing; actors playing the supposed \"real people;\" and parroting of the same played out political tropes we\\'re all beyond sick of.Do yourself a favor and just watch the trailer - all the funny moments are in it anyway. Then flip on the original; it\\'s superior in every metric.,Borat is hilarious and a treat to watch... Again! BUT this was much less of a social satire than the first one and it was too literal politically. Many scenes; such as the father-daughter ball; even though hilarious; make you think they were put in there just to have the good old Borat doing his thing. And they make you wonder: Are they really integral to the story? (Not really). What are they trying to say? (Unclear). To whole satire of the civilized western society trying to educate Borat in the first film; was much more effective and spot-on.,Not doubting genius of SKB but current times is not suitable to enjoy this kind of comedy based on reality,I was expecting more this time around. However; the movie disappointed me; as it was very similar to previous movies; relying on shocking and misleading \\'participants\\' for comedy; with a weak plot holding it together.On the positive side; while continuing to expose prejudices; he also showed the warm side of Americans such as older Jewish women and right wing men.The famous Giuliani scene was not as damning as expected. While he was lecherous; he was mostly charming and supportive.,Sacha is back as Borat; and by gods is it a cringeworthy cocktail of hilarity. There\\'s lots of folk that won\\'t like this and simply dismiss it as crass and dumb; and on the surface you could be forgiven for thinking so; but it is anything but. Sacha is his usual amazing self; always staying in character through situations that would quite frankly have me pissing my pants laughing. The real treat here is his daughter. I\\'ve never seen Maria Bakalova before; but she more than holds her own on the screen and even outshines in a lot of scenes. Equally as fearless and fun as Sacha and a great sport for putting herself in a potentially bad situation with a prominent American figure. Trump supporters will no doubt cry fake and throw stones; but without verging into spoiler territory I\\'d say it was pretty obvious what happened and I\\'ll say no more; other than I doubt Sacha would compromise his artistic integrity by lying. It was clear to me his only concern was cutting it short to keep his co star safe and unharmed. Good man!,I\\'m not concerned about his political message.I simply found it to be disrespectful to women and disgusting.This time he took it too far; and that\\'s saying a lot.,When I watch comedies then I like to watch them to be light hearted and hopefully somewhat intelligent. This movie is a 90 minute political propaganda movie with absolutely no laughs.Even the Giuliani \\'hands down the pants moment\\' is sooo staged! His face is covered in parts. The actress basically untucks his shirt and Giuliani; a 76 yr old fat man; goes to tuck them back in - and the movie just got their perfect fake news moment to promoted themselves. Probably the only reason people actually go to watch the movie.The whole premise is silly - that Kazakhstan govt released the Wuhan virus because they were angry at the world for laughing at them.And I used to think Cohen was an intelligent man; but looks like he has lost that magic and hence why this movies is hoping to cash in on some Trump/Republican bashing. Shame Cohen can\\'t have success just on his own but has to lean in on Trump/Republican and election time to try and profit.Total bore of a movie. and if you have 90 minutes of time to waste then go ahead and watch grass grow; it will be better than watching this movie.,In the current state of America; tensions are already high. Borat is here to fuel the fire against the republicans - if you\\'re looking for a movie that\\'s 90 minutes of \"LoOk At HoW sTuPiD tRuMp SuPpOrTeRs Are!\" then this is the title for you.It\\'s a complete disappointment. And as others have mentioned; it\\'s been rushed to come out before the election and that\\'s very obvious. The production quality is low; the story is basic and almost non-existant; the characters lack depth. There\\'s about 5 funny scenes in the entire thing. Not at all worth anybody\\'s time.,I wasn\\'t excited for Borat 2 because I didn\\'t love the original which I seen back in 2007 so I was 18. Both films are fine; I don\\'t know which is better.The humor is inconsistent; it works sometimes. Yes; I laughed out loud a few times like the Trump stuff. Borat is really edgy like the original in fact the period scene disgusted me. There are some forced jokes like Borat running around half naked and the plot was forced.If you loved Borat; you probably seen this already. If you hated Borat; you may hate this even more. If you didn\\'t mind Borat like myself; it\\'s worth seeing once.,I don\\'t understand why poeple say it\\'s not as good as the 1st movie; i watched the 2 today and they\\'re both funny and it\\'s pretty much the same style that i\\'d never guess it\\'s 14 years between the 2 movies already; this movie is truly much better in the technical aspect and it has more funny moments too at least for me; the actress who played the daughter did an amazing job and i liked her character development; so she added a lot to the concept of Borat.\\nI really enjoyed this movie a lot and i hope poeple will stop comparing the 2 because it felt more like a continuity.,Just watch all the old clips of Ali G on youtube. You\\'ll have a blast. That show was incredibly funny and still holds up.,Oh dear. I do wish film studios would stop funding fake reviews.This film is such a let down. I think I laughed once and it wasn\\'t at the humiliation of a lovely old Jewish lady or the vulgar menstrual blood dance.The first Borat and Bruno were hilarious but this one? Nah. I think Cohen might have had his day. Even the accent was strained.,Boring and not funny; hour and a half of boredom..,Traded completely on the original film; (which was very funny). Bar a few funny moments; it was pretty dire and painful to watch. Avoid.,Funny when he\\'s just being an artist/comedian.Actors now think their political opinion matters.Ummm; Nope.What made him famous? Being hilarious.This movie is so self-indulgent. Using his fame to tear down a country where he has no responsibility. No vested interest = spewing at the mouth.I kept trying to watch. Don\\'t waste your time.,While the first movie flowed; this felt forced and quite try hard throughout. Most \"victims\" seemed aware early and everything after that just broke any sort of illusion knowing that footage was needed. It\\'s a shame as the first was a genuinely good watch; and I was thoroughly looking forward to this; but almost nothing worked here.\\nMaybe worth a watch for the most die hard of SBC fans; but I wouldn\\'t spend money on a movie ticket; wait until it\\'s streamable or on TV,I watched the this skeptical that I was going to see a lot of recycled gags and that it would come across as a desperate attempt to revive a character that should be left in the past. Instead this movie goes in a completely different direction and the satire is absolutely perfect for the year 2020.,Loved every minute of it! Looking forward to watching it again.,I consider Borat Cultural learnings etc. to be one of the best comedies ever made; so although I was excited for this; I was hesitant because I didn\\'t except it could match up to the original. I was wrong. This is some of Sacha\\'s best work; and the climax of the movie (no spoilers) is absolutely jaw dropping.I give it an 8-9 only because it didn\\'t have as much of the narrative + real world blending; a lot more of it was scripted than the original. That isn\\'t to say that this makes it boring; just that obviously Sacha is at his best during real world scenes. I must also acknowledge that many people have reviewed this quite low most likely because of political leanings; but even I; who consider myself more right leaning found this to be a completely transparent and truthful look at the sad state of America.Everyone has prime so I see no reason anyone shouldn\\'t watch this.,Unlike the first Borat movie (and his appearance in Ali G before that) this Borat movie rarely manages to drive big points home. If I had to guess; it\\'s partly because of the (ironically probably more thought through) script making it seem less genuine; relying too much on pure shock (ala Bruno); or simply being victim of measuring up to the past success of Borat.I think Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s recent Who Is America is honestly a much better watch if you\\'re interested in contemporary American politics and society. Borat: Subsquent Moviefilm simply doesn\\'t manage to show us much that\\'s worth remembering a week; a month; or a year from now (despite being linked to the election). I had a good time watching it with the family though and had more than a few laughs; so I will rate it mid way as such.,Ugh. How the mighty have fallen. I\\'ve seen better \"prank\" videos and humor from YouTube hacks with no film-making experience. Crude; discriminatory; and just awful and pointless.,Absolute garbage movie. I loved Borat back in 2006. This was just a garage follow-up. The scenes were boring and the whole setup of him \"bringing\" his daughter to USA is just plain boring. The daughter-actor was garbage too.,BSM; also known as \\'HAH! We Get The Rudy\\'; is a \\'been there done that\\' tale with less payoffs and laughs than the first BORAT. If you have followed the Press stories regarding this film......you have seen the film.,It\\'s a one joke act and once you see through it isn\\'t as funny anymore. The first one was hilarious; this one just felt like forced propaganda.Borat should\\'ve stayed back in 2006.,Every interaction they have with a person is just stupid and clearly fake; in no way do normal people react like that!,GIVE THIS FILM A 10 OR YOU WILL BE EXECUTE.Sacha Baron Cohen has writen history once more. Great success my man.,Awful. The worst movie I have ever seen. The stereotyping is very unpleasant and to some extent even fake and gives huge misconception. Deserves 0 ratings. It\\'s too politically dumb as well. I can write too much; but not worth my time. As I already wasted 2 hours of my time watching it.\\nLastly; Sacha is even hypocrite. He talks about how people should respect each other; when in fact he himself is not applying his own advice. He is talentedly exhausted and broke; and has nothing new to offer on screen.,This ridiculously outrageous movie-film makes tribute to the first Borat. It is amazing how Borat is allowed to live and breathe in the very fierce 2020 Covid atmosphere. Even through it is quite offensive; we can only laugh at the ridiculous statement people say. I thought that it wouldn\\'t work out but oh my god; it delivered!Also the character arc is amazing and how the characters changes and the disguises which reminded me of his other films. The father-daughter ending almost made me cry.This made me laugh outloud for an entire 2 hoursVery-nice!,Great moviefilm; fourth best moviefilm in all of Kazakhstan.,Ultimately it\\'s an 8-9 rating but giving it a 10 for the eventual magats that give it a 1.,For a supposed comedy it was painful to sit through; not worth watching,Too political for me; its like a borat movie made by cnn. Seems like it was rushed together for the elections.,The first Borat movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. This was the most disappointing sequel I have ever seen. It was just terrible. Very sad; I was so looking forward to watching this movie.,The world needs to stop communism; (this communism includes Chinese socialism),Very seldom do I laugh until I cry and get a pain in my jaws.\\nI am very thankful that he made this movie just for me.,Love it if you are for Biden; hate it if you are for a good and complete film.,This doesn\\'t even compare to the first one; it\\'s very boring and not that funny. It\\'s a bit too political for me; I couldn\\'t wait for it to be over,Not that funny; not a patch on first movie and a political hit job.,NAHT.What made the first Borat great was the authenticity of it. Borat felt like a real person coming to America and divulging in the culture for the first time. This movie feels more like watching an SNL member do a terrible impression of Borat than it feels like Borat himself. At least with the former there can be some humor residing in the satire of it all. This movie is like listening to that kid you went to high school with do a poor rendition of the Borat voice for the 100th time. And we all know how pleasurable that was.,It\\'s hilarious; but I was really moved by the daughter-father story. Maria Bakalova is a star. Anyway. Go see this gem. 10 out of 10.Sorry; I forgot; it features the nicest person on earth - Jeanie :),Been long time fan of SBC. Even dressed as Ali G on Halloween. This was pure propaganda. Like the Simpsons were in off episodes. I laughed out loud once for this. It\\'s not funny to trap people and make fun of them.,I couldn\\'t care less if he made fun of Republicans; The original BORAT was hilarious. But this movie is clearly just a big ok smear campaign for the left. It\\'s just an hour and a half of BORAT Virtue Signaling to you how stupid Pro Trumpers are. Wish it could\\'ve just kept all politics out of it(or atleast remained neutral and not picked any sides).,The title says it all;this is a last ditch effort propaganda movie to smear the big bad orange man;featuring borat.,Apparently everyone now rated movies based on their political view now too. It\\'s funny; it\\'s satire. You should be able to laugh whether you are democrat or republican. I thought the jokes were well done.,Borat 2 portrays the true colors of Trump\\'s America.\\nAs the last message from the movie suggests; Go vote!Another comedy masterpiece starring Baron Cohen! Must see!!,My world is still alive. And I just started doubting that. Blown away. Easily the best entertainment of last decade. It\\'s so traumatic (in a best possible way) that credits are rolling as i type; but I can\\'t remember 90% of the gags. I feel being alive again; thanks Sacha. PS. I\\'m a \\'republican snowflake\\' and NRA member.,FAF......sacha baron cohen i\\'m really appreciate your guts man!!!!!..,...and Even though you probably should not compare the two movies; you still do. A couple of really funny and/or unbelievable scenes but most of it trying to be a normal comedy movie.\\nProbably would not watch a third one.,This Brit can make some of the wackiest stuff! I thought parts of it were hysterical and others cringeworthy.PS> my partner only give it a 1 or 2 and said that\\'s time gone from their life.,I was counting the days to watch Borat 2 as I was thinking it would be as good as Borat 1. How wrong I was... Borat 2 is boring to death. I was watching it lying down on my couch and I fell asleep halfway through the film.,Highly disappointed. There were some funny parts throughout the movie; but absolutely nothing compared to the humor in the original Borat. The real life bits weren\\'t nearly as funny; I found the daughter to be somewhat annoying; and the scripted parts ruined the movie as a whole. The original Borat was genius; one of the best comedy movies; arguably; of all time. This... was nowhere near. This was a missed chance at a great sequel.,There is a reason this went right to Amazon. We seen the first Borat at a movie theater and everyone was laughing from start to finish. This movie was not funny but just gross.,Same old Borat... which is a very good thing.I mean the only scene I disliked and cringed at was the father-daughter dance; but I laughed so hard at all the jokes about the US President... I forget his name -- just kidding I know what it is; in case republican read this. But what struck me the most was how much of a political move this was to make this movie; but raised eyebrows for me as well. I think I\\'m mostly entertained at the fact Sasha Baron Cohen is the best and most dedicated troll on Earth that doesn\\'t care about who he pisses off; as long as his own mission is complete and goals are reached.,Fairly disappointed I did expect more; but still very funny at times,A really rushed movie that was clearly made to make people not to vote for trump thats it. Laughed maybe once or twice but the problem was that it had the same jokes which was the daughter being dumb and learning stuff and that was just really boring. I understand why they made this movie but was it really necessary?,If you liked the first Borat; you\\'ll like this one as well.,I was so worried this film was going to be a disappointment after the genius of the first movie but I needn\\'t worried. Another brilliantly; hilarious experience. Loved it!,Clearly too many people already know Borat. Funny movie at times but no longer scandalous as before. Donald Trump and Co. are the new target. Perfect movie for Joe Biden\\'s campaign.,Just watched on Amazon Prime. I\\'m in my mid sixties and cringing; hooting and laughing all at the same time. Greatest respect to Sasha; the cast and crew. I think that this is better than the original. How does he get away with it??!! 10/10!!,If you like absolute silliness; outrageous behavior and total insanity; this is the film for you. True to the Borat style; where reality and fiction meet. It was dull in some parts and so funny in others that you will gag laughing. And as always; totally edgy plot lines for each scene.,Its a attempted smear campaign towards Republicans and that is litterally all it is.,Sacha felt tired and out of energy. The jokes didn\\'t pack a punch as in the first Borat movie. I ended up stopping half way through with no desire to watch the other half.,Absolutely brilliant sequel; great to have borat back and some of the scenes with his daughter are great who is also superb. Highly recommended. High Five🤚,A great addition and resolution to the first film. It delivered in ways that still felt original while still being incredibly funny. For those stating that it\\'s degrading women; are missing the point (and subject) of the majority of the film. If you feel this way I highly recommend you rewatch it and understand who exactly the film is making fun of.,It is a disgusting; repulsive slop of a movie.\\nTotally unbelieveable that it is all a series of \"hidden cam\" pranks; feels scripted all the way.\\nJust not worth your time watching it.\\nIt is also offensive how he speaks polish-kazkh made-up language; his daughter speaks in bulgarian and I watched it with Amazon\\'s official subtitles that at certain moments don\\'t have anything to do with what she\\'s saying. It is basically like they told her talk whatever you want no one will understand you anyway. The humor in this thing is deprived of any taste.,His movies are a gold standard when it comes to real social experiments used in movies... And exposes the ugly primal instincts of people... Great movie,Big fan of Borat. Thought the first movie was brilliant but this was just slow and boring.with only a few good sketches.,This is a very funny movie; but I don\\'t think it lives up to the first one. I really like how Borat\\'s relationship with his daughter grows though.The girl who plays Borat\\'s daughter is a great actress. I hope her career skyrockets because of this.,Perhaps not as good as the first but awfully close...,This is more than a hilarious comedy. This exposes the racist and intolerant underbelly of America; possibly more effectively than the original film.,Disjointed and unfunny- Borat has never been funny.,Imagine the first Borat. Now take away everything you enjoyed from the film; like the sketches with real people and shock humor and replace it with political propaganda and obviously scripted/paid actors. That\\'s basically what Borat 2 is.,One of the worst movie ever. Really bad humor or lack there of,Low ratings must be from the takedown targets of the movie. I dont think they would really watch it though.,I\\'m a big fan of Eric Andre and Frank Hassle kinda stuff; I know it\\'s dumb; but at least there are some laughs to be had. The jokes were so dry and stupid I didn\\'t crack a smile the entire time. It just seems like he was trying way too hard to be funny so it just had the opposite effect. Combine that with all of the propaganda doo doo and it\\'s basically just a massive waste of time.,Not funny at all. it\\'s a very lame repetition of the original.... don\\'t waste your time.\\nAngry liberal trying to score points among other angry liberals. It\\'s not original or not funny anymore. Humor should be beyond that....,Awful story; unfunny; terrible acting. The first borat was bad enough but this reaches new depths of awfulness.,Watching what he has done in the past. This movie just tackles and gets into the political part more than anything; which it was a dissapointment.Is worth watching if you wanna know what people were talking for a brief moment before the elections of 2020; but that\\'s about it.,After the first 45 minutes it was trash. The first movie was pure genius. This is just anti American nonsense.,It was kind of a political expose as he pranked Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani.\\nRudy had a compromising scene in a hotel room with borat\\'s daughter which might raise some moral questions.I cried till my stomach hurt but I kinda liked the first Borat more because of the social experiments in that but this is a MUST WATCH if u can take some offensive jokes which I\\'m sure u can lmao.*there is a cameo of T_m H_nks*,A comedy movie that isn\\'t funny is like a romantic movie without a love story. This has failed on every level of \"comedy\"; don\\'t waste your time watching it.,Well; there\\'s 90 minutes of my life I\\'ll never get back. Slow; boring; and not nearly as good as the first.,There were so many occasions I began breaking out into fits of laughter and so many other moments of impulsive cringing. Unbelievably well done; we are so fortunate to have an artist like\\nSacha Baron Cohen sharing his art with us.,There are some parts that will make you smile or laugh a little but most of it is political and not really that funny. Sequels are always worst than the first one and this was true for this sequel.,This movie was not funny and cringeworthy at times. Does not come close to original.,This movie goes much deeper than anything Hollywood is used to making. This takes the natural reactions and culture of the world not a make believe idea of American culture.,Couldn\\'t have wished for a better time for a Borat subsequent movie. love Cohen; love Maria; & love the blooming daughter-father bond. enough shock value to be a Borat movie; however; we all know the very real & necessary message of this movie;),Sad reality; made me laugh at the same time.\\nHope to see other movies with Sasha soon,Not as good as his earlier movies. There are a couple of funny moments; but it\\'s mostly humor based on grossing out the audience instead of deserving bigots and powerful fools being exposed and mocked. I much prefer the latter.,This movie had some funny moments but my memories of Borat from back in 2007 are more funny than how Borat actually was and is. Borat provided a lot of laughs back then,Can see the review scores being so varied on this; but what would you expect? This just shows the stupidity of not just repressed nations but the so called land of the free under the trump Republicans control.\\nMany laugh out loud moments for me; if you don\\'t get this or are highly offended you are the problem in a 2020 world wanting to move forward into the 30s whilst preferring wanting to live in a 1620 world. In fact why are you even watching this? It\\'s on Amazon go back to BBC 1 or CBS or ABC or whatever.Funniest film of 2020Sasha you\\'ve still got it and a great breakout performance from the lovely Maria Bakalova.,Horrible movie. Only a few laughs with the rest being a propaganda film. Not even borat,Great to see Borat back in action; unfortunately the movie is notably worse than the original (is anyone really surprised?!). Still around a 7/10 and definitely Worth watching for those few classic Borat moments (not to mention the lack of any decent new content for months!); but overall it definitely could/should have been better. Not even as funny as Bruno but still had a few good laughs and better still; the nostalgia of when Borat ruled the world!!! I\\'ve been a fan since his original HBO show and I\\'m glad to see Borat still spreading his Hrum everywhere! Go in with lowish expectations and enjoy!!!,I\\'ve no doubt Sacha Baron Cohen is a talented guy but this film!! I couldn\\'t watch it all; it was awful; cringey and poor taste I turned it off after 15 minutes and that was too much! Absolute crap! I never stopped laughing at the first Borat film but didn\\'t find this funny at all,People rating with 10; are you crazy or just trols.?Totally boring movie; poor quality and story.,I didn\\'t like it at all.\\nI am a big fan of first Borat but this one ruined my good memories from the first movie.\\nThe main reason was that; the story of some one strange with American culture was already spoiled with first Borat; in fact Borat 2 was a fade version of the first one.\\nAlso I believe the character of Borat\\'s daughter wasn\\'t a cool partner for Borat. In first Borat his colleague (Azamat) was an ideal character to complete Borat\\'s character while the lack of this supporting character was obvious in the second.\\nHonestly; I was disappointed with second one while the first one was one of the best comedies I\\'ve seen.,It\\'s not filmed with a secret camera; so he has gone into all these interviews with these \"Unhuman Monsters\" with a cameraman? and its not hidden in a bag; as the camera moves round. I mean the cake shop; now the woman might have just been out for money; but she would not have done that on camera; as he shop would be finished which I would hope it now is,10/10 very NICE. A return to form with a wonderful addition of Tutar; Borat\\'s daughter.,Note there are some spoilers. Its important to recognize that to a degree this was or attempted to be a political commentary and as one it fell flat. The 3 major spots it hit on were 1. the pence/cpac scene. Opening is funny but the disdane and disgust on the face of pence showed it was an inappropriate and mistimed joke. 2. on the list is the rights rally and it stands to say in my research i found that there is actually a very large amount from that scene that didnt make it in the film. And finally 3. guiliani (its spelled wrong) unfortunately this scene is not a satire scene. Telling; disheartening and most of all disgusting but belongs more as a scandal and catch a creep than in a satire film.Now the good stuff. Despite politics the movie actually gives a lot of hope in the people of this country. The biggest part for me was the synagogue scene with the old lady. To have such a genuinely nice lady like that. She took cohen\\'s character at face value and was nothing but polite and nice and even fed him. The same sentiment was felt with the 2 men who took him in during quarantine. Political opinions aside the reality is they took him in of their own free will and volition and helped out a person who needed a place to stay.In short when the research is done on the film it is even more heart warming to see some of the things in the film. And should be watched.,Tons of adult fun; and the real scenes with Pence and Giuliani take the cake. Brilliant in so many ways; politically motivated; and executed very well. Bravo...bine le ai facut.,The original was offensive but funny. This movie is offensive and not funny. Totally degrading of women. Some people say that is the whole point of the movie but it\\'s very strange to disgrade people to an unrealistic degree to make a point.,Almost all of the interactions are clearly staged. It\\'s transparent.Most of the attempts at humour seem designed primarily to serve a political agenda. So Baron-Cohen has gone from once daring comedian to political activist with comedy an afterthought.,This is satire of the highest order. I haven\\'t laughed that hard in quite sometime. Maria Bakalova is a complete revelation and (almost) steals the show. A 10 * movie.,Baron Cohen is a genius. Honestly this is one of the funniest films ever and just as good as the first one; if not better!,When I first saw the original Borat movie I thought it was amazing. This one is just equally good if not better at many points. Sascha Baron Cohen is a true artist when it comes to exsposing the true Nature of Modern society and he does it while maintaining a good and positive sense of humour. From the top politician to the well-manered family to the everyday delivery man who does not seem to be bothered by the fact that a human person is trapped within a box. He grabs the most essential problems today and showcases them in brutal but yet honest ways and he does not care. I\\'ll guess that is what makes these movies so damn good.,The movie is extremely bad and exaggerated. It is so anti-trump that it is laughable; and also in perfect release for the election.,Great success! Releasing this movie a week and a half before the election is comedic timing at its greatest! Super cringe at moments; hilarious at others; all around this movie film was amazing!! Hi five! Also; get out there and vote!,I didnt think this movie would be amazing so many years after the original but it was very very funny. I generally do not laugh out loud at movies but this had me going the whole way through. There was a lot of cringe so if you like that and the style of comedy of Borat 1 you\\'ll love the sequel.,A lot of it is silly; but overall; it\\'s quite funny. The scene with Borat and his daughter dancing was both disgusting and funny. I imagine some people won\\'t like it; and I can understand why; but I thought it was funny.,Watched this with a few friends ans we were howling with laughter many times! You\\'ll love it!,The predecessor from 2006 is better; more authentic; and has a greater number of funny scenes. The context back then also makes you convinced how the interviewee would agree to have a camera around and would be OK being filmed. But this time; some scenes seem staged with \"actors\" in on the joke; like the scene with the \"babysitter.\" If she\\'s not an actress; how is a camera in that situation justified? At any rate; Maria Bakalova is the true revelation here. She can certainly hold her own; and her commitment is impressive. Notice how she doesn\\'t hesitate to eat the lipstick; and then Borat immediately copies her; like \"That is funny and brilliant. Let me be seen doing that too!\",Borat keeps exposing the worst America has to offer; and if you don\\'t that then the joke is probably about you!,Haha it must take some bottle to do those things 😂 really enjoyed it!Great watch!,Funnier than the original because the US has changed and the film highlights this to brilliant comic effect.,Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s revival of our favourite Kazakh reporter is another stroke of genius; and Maria Bakalova adds to the fun as Borat\\'s daughter; playing a brilliant role.Although not as racy as the first film (probably due to legal lessons learned) this is still typical Borat for the fans.,Sascha Baron Cohen has no problem caving to Hollyweird by going after Mike Pence or framing Rudy Giuliani before a major election but he would never have the stones to do a movie about Joe Biden and his corrupt family. The sequel falls flat on it\\'s face in comparison to the original; a movie that I actually laughed at and enjoyed.,Typical over-the-top; childish; gutter soup ... as expected.\\nNot made for children but made for children.,With the return of Borat; I did not expect it to be entertaining but it prove me wrong. With this film; it has more meaning to it especially with family values. I love this a lot especially the twist at the end.,Wow! just when you think Borat couldn\\'t get any more outrageous and bold he outdid himself in the biggest way possible. Is it better than the first one? Me personally no; but its still better than most of the movies that are playing out there.,A true smorgasbord of comedic stylings!!! taming the pc and bold alike...very nearly making; truly; equal fun of all people. a full folly! all sorts of cringe an absurdly fascinating wow wow wow. damn.CONCEPTUAL AND EDITING GENIOUS!!!,Pointless and reputative. Nothing new or interesting overly political and boring,The most ridiculous; senseless; disgusting and pointless comedy I\\'ve ever seen. Couldn\\'t watch more than 10 minutes of the movie. I hoped to enjoy a good comedy like The dictator; but was deeply disappointed.,Stupid; just stupid. Not worth my time. I watched to see what the big Giuliani thing was about; it as just him adjusting his pants. I can\\'t believe that this movie got any good reviews; simply not funny,Its great seeing Borat return with a sequel but the jokes are a little forced this time around. Its OK ; just don\\'t expect it to be as funny as the first.,Movie flat and not funny...BUT Maria Bakalova is a fresh new star...Worth your time to see her in action...but dat\\'s it...,Some geniuine laughs in this; I respect Cohen is gutsy enough to make these kind of jokes whether staged or not. Although I didn\\'t mind the daughter story line I felt like it would of been better if he was solo. Other sequels spring to mind where a daughter was introduced such as dumber and dumber to and jay and silent Bob: reboot; both which where very disappointing. Overall funny but can\\'t compare to the first but still an overall decent film. I mean the moon dance come on....,This movie is hilarious!!! Don\\'t listen to the negative comments about the movie! It is just the Trumplicans are upset that they are being called out on their BS!,People will go see this movie expecting more of the LOL-inducing hijinx that Sasha Baron Cohen brings as Borat; but I hope they\\'ll be pleasantly surprised by how much heart this sequel brings to the table. Much more plot-driven and emotional than its predecessor; maybe a tempering of expectations is needed but still a very fun and rewarding watch nonetheless.,Sacha baron cohen is a comedy genius. If you don\\'t laugh at this movie you\\'re dead inside,Repulsive movie; lowest kind of humor possible. Don\\'t waste 90 minutes of your time on this awful movie. I am genuinely surprised that Amazon even chose to be streaming it.,Nothing really bad about it; it never pulled me in and made me feel invested.,Giving a 10; to plump the 1 star reviews by the Trump brigade.,I was not expecting this movie to be so good to be honest. I laughed out loud and I applaud everyone that was brave enough and so clever to make such an amazing movie in a time of need. Thanks!!,Not being a huge fan of the first Borat film; I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud so much for this sequel. It had more heart in it too. The relationship growth between Borat and his daughter Tutar was kind of sweet.I enjoyed being horrified by the extremely uncomfortable moments. All except the part regarding Rudy Giuliani. The Tutar character (Borat\\'s daughter) poses as a reporter to interview \"America\\'s Mayor\". She\\'s nervous; awestruck; flirtatious; and the old man just ate that up. He kept reaching across to touch her hands to \"reassure\" her. He has no problem being led into a bedroom by her and even lays back on the bed to adjust something in his pants. Zero funny about that.Unlike all the other uncomfortable moments in the film; this part just angered and nauseated me. It wasn\\'t rehearsed or fictional; and I guess that\\'s the point. That was the Real Rudy. A creepy and lecherous monster. A definite skin-crawling scene.Seems like Sacha Baron Cohen has matured. He wrote a much better film that mixes the fictional characters with the real people in a more effective way. In the first Borat film; which I didn\\'t hate; just wasn\\'t keen on it; the character was obnoxious for obnoxiousness sake. This time around; there\\'s a definite message.Oh yeah; and there are lots of gross-out moments; much to the amusement of the 13-year-old portion of my brain. I\\'ll be repeat viewing.Watch for the Tom Hanks appearance - fantastic moment!,Didn\\'t laugh so hard with a movie for years; SBC it\\'s an amazing actor and with humor tests the frailties of our society; giving us this masterpieces,Mr. Cohen gets laughs by embarrassing others in vulnerable moments. How about we find some special private moments in his life and set him up for embarrassment? How will he handle seeing himself or family members shamed? Make funny laugh laugh? A contest anyone?,Don\\'t waste your time; It\\'s not like the first one; just a massive cringe fest.... Its almost as if the movie was motivated by politics and not entertainment.\\nSasha man; you can do better.....very disappointed.,I\\'m a huge fan of the first movie which I watched at least 5 times. This one however; is horrible. Nearly everything is scripted and full with \"cheap\" laughs. Feels like some kind of slapstick someone that likes Jeff Dunham would enjoy.,Being a big fan of the first film; was very disappointed this time around. the shocking unexpected vulgar comedy that made up the success for the first production felt very unapparent in this sequel. The for shadowing of jokes was to upfront making a lot of the comedy predictable and less enjoyable whilst lacking the shocking surprise from a vulgar joke.,I understand the fact that this movie got good reviews and high stars for the people it is against in government. But after all it is supposed to be a comedy movie. And as a comedy this is worse than average. Not funny except for few scenes. And people praise the acting; but there is nothing special about it.,Funny. That\\'s it;it\\'s really f-king funny. Sasha is a beast.,Hes still irrelevant and honestly alot of these people he treated this way lost their jobs after he conned them.,Going into this as a huge fan of the first one. I thought it would be a big let down but to my surprise it was on par with first one. While I do still like the first one a bit more. I liked the story and where they took Borat\\'s character. Adding his daughter into the mix was hilarious and where they go with it I didn\\'t see coming especially with Borat\\'s character. Although a lot more this time around is scripted the non- scripted parts are still great but are no where near as close to the first. Although the moment with a political figure I don\\'t see how that figure will comeback from this. All in all I was surprised with final film really funny while not topping the first I think IMO its not to far behind the first easy 8/10. Also shout out to amazon for releasing it early.,I loved the first Borat film and the sketches from Da Ali G show; but I don\\'t feel the same about this movie. The first Borat movie had me in stitches throughout the whole film; this one didn\\'t. There were parts that were funny; but there were also parts that weren\\'t and kinda felt like the same joke gets dragged on.,Very funny and entertaining. Love the Borat Film the first time and this time it was just as good and definitely lived up to my expectations. Just love Sacha Baron Cohen.,It is as good as the first movie; possibly better! It was the funniest movie I\\'ve seen in ages; and it was exactly what I needed during this dark time in world history.There are 2 kinds of people in this world. There are people who actually have a sense of humor; and will find this crazy; insanely funny.Then there are people with no sense of humor.It is as simple as that!,Sacha Baron Cohen is in fine form and Maria Bakalova is a discovery. The two provide an uncommon depth to the movie--two people brainwashed by a nationalistic; puritanical regime (sound familiar?) realizing the truth. The faux abortion sequence is hilarious. And their learning the truths shows people can learn from their mistakes and become better people. MAGA folk; not known for their sense of humor will be offended but most people will have more than a few laughs.,Made this 2020 less miserable. I adore Sacha\\'s humor. This is a masterpiece. Worth watching.,The film was so mediocre that both me and my companion predicted that he must have gotten somebody in an awkward position after 20 minutes of movie time; in fact it\\'s almost as if the whole film is structured around that one Rudy scene. In theory it\\'s interesting that you catch a politician in an awkward position and instead of just releasing a the clip; you make a whole film around it. But in practice; the whole film is a chore; full of cringe and not funny moments. Sacha is clearly just a leftist who is triggered by Trump; and while this isn\\'t a problem in itself; it\\'s quite clear he can\\'t express this in a very creative way; probably the worse thing he has made to date. It also seems to me that unlike the original Borat; a much higher proportion of people in the film are actors; and this kills a lot of the humor. I find it really quite strange that so many people revere who thrives on mocking humiliating people after lying and manipulating them to be in awkward position; at the very least it seemed like the harm was bounded when it wasn\\'t political.,Funny; silly; but wow; he gets those messages of truths out there; to the naive; Mainstream media swallowing masses; like the stuff about the PLandemic; vaccines; and how a \\'certain nation\\' control the media; and the USA banking cartels!,There were no funny bits in this disgusting movie; and not in any way would I recommend it,Firstly WHY??? There was no need for a second movie. The first one was great; so innovative and so damn funny. This second one sorry just doesn\\'t cut it. I think Cohen is relying too much on shock value rather than being genuinely clever and funny.There are some shocking moments again pushing the envelope but that\\'s exactly what he wants obviously and that will get more viewers and raise publicity.I didn\\'t laugh once.The daughter premise wasn\\'t convincing although the actor was great the storyline was almost like she was an added extra and the awkward moments together didn\\'t really work.Please don\\'t make a third!,I watched Borat I; interesting. A dictator; too. This; I don\\'t know how to define. One of the worst movies of 2020; and there were some really bad ones.,Not as funny as Borat 1 or Bruno even his America Tv Show.Only part worth it is the Giuliani prank. The rest of the movie is not that good or funny.The actress who play his daughter is very funny.Honestly if you manage to just see the Giuliani clip online the whole movie isn\\'t worth it.,I was excite. It was exactly what I expected. Good time. Very nice.,A genius display of current events.\\nDont expect everyone to like this; if you know what I mean :),I think many scenes were too short. They had more footage but for some reason many scenes were like cut in half. Also some seemed to be totally pointless and added nothing to the movie. The editing was just awful.The girl felt more natural to me. I don\\'t say it was acting as it was not. Anybody can go out and do this; but only they do it. The people they interacted with felt like they were just bad actors. Especially the doctor.It was fun overall. The jewish and the singing part just killed me.,They did this movie only for the elections. They attack Trump all time. The first one was different because they did a critique in different sectors. It\\'s clear this is a anti Trum political movie.,Whilst it had some funny moments was not nearly as good as the first one and was EXTREMELY political with the timing of the release definitely not a coincidence - if as much time was spent on making a funny movie instead of promoting the democrats party by bagging out the republicans I\\'m sure it could have been hilarious however Hollywood with it\\'s left wing agenda it was never going to be that way,Not nearly as clever or funny as the first one. The singing at the hillbilly rally was funny but nothing else really.,Meh like three chuckles during the whole movie too political.,Couldn\\'t wait to watch this and was not disappointed. Such a fan. At last a really entertaining film during this difficult time. Such a relief. He is such an amazing comedian. Very original; no one else even gets close. Very near the mark; snowflakes need not apply ha ha.,I liked The Dictator and the first Borat movie but this instalment is simply vulgar.Cohen is a talented comedian but fails to be one in this film. Rather than be witty he makes the most base jokes employing stereotypes that become stale almost immediately.I would like to see Cohen produce a film like Lost in Translation but maybe he is not capable.,Not even close to first Borat. Too much politics identity in this one...2 or 3 times I laugh. First 40-50 min looks lika a lifetime; not funny at all...,Borat is back. This sequel is good but just not like the first one. There a definitely some funny parts; but I found myself cringing and looking away for a lot of the movie. Very political as well.,This was a chore to finish watching! I feel sorry for this guy! This character is all he can do? It\\'s not even funny anymore just stupid! I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay to see this.\\nTotal waste of time!,I watched it. I thought it was funny at times; but it pales in comparison to the masterpiece that was the first film.The mocumentary aspect of the first film is completely lost here; and it is just a structured movie like Bruno was.Bottom line; if this was about Joe Biden the critics would be giving it 5/10\\'s as well. The only reason it is getting \"rave\" reviews is because it is about Donald Trump and those that associate with the Republican party.Is it worth a watch? Sure. I was entertained but outside of that it is one time watch for me.,It was the movie we needed right now. It had a lot of heart and was different from the first Borat film but none the less great!,I found the first 20 minutes funny. The rest was a bit forced. Trouble is that Borat is quite recognisable these days so you lose the illusion that it is not staged even though everything is... And that is a big problem with this film for me as it\\'s just too bogus.,I dont think so many people in the US and A would be so offended by this movie. Last 4 years just proved that Americans tolerate differences to a point it gets All of us to laugh over the stupidity.I loved the movie.,I thought it was a strong movie for Baron-Cohen fans and the left will love it and be frustrated by it in equal measures. Still lots of laugh out loud moments and a couple of very potent cringe scenes. There were also a couple of scenes of genuine humanity to balance it out that I found the first movie lacked.Maria Bakalova completely steals every scene she is in and is an absolute treasure. I expect big things from her in the future.,I enjoyed this film but it was never going to have the same belly laughter as the first one. Much more scripted and forced.That said; it was still fun to watch. Sacha Baron Cohen never disappoints. The actress who plays his daughter did very well too.It was more like a buddy comedy than the original film which is in its own league,This was very funny. You know what to expect going in. I laughed many times. I\\'d recommend this.,There is nothing that produces even a chuckle. I only got through 45 minutes of this limp duck. The scenes are dragged out way too long and their premise is unimaginative. The fax \\'sup\\' gag borders on torture. The monkey bit; really? I think the monkey is the only one laughing because it got out of the movie early.\\nThis whole movie should have been a 5 minute skit on SNL; which is equally unfunny.\\nThis seems to be only a vehicle for Cohen to wear disguises and boor people with no wit.\\nMaybe it got funny after 45 minutes but I won\\'t be back to find out.\\nI gave it a two just for getting the movie produced in times of covid.,People; don\\'t waste your time watching this movie becouse it will be one bad decision; you will regret; I just lost twoo hour\\'s from my life.\\nI never even see a movie so badly made; actor\\'s; etc.\\nWhy the hell this Director Mister Jason Woliner\\nwill connect Kazakhstan with gipsy and romanian language; plus de virus Covit19. Only to a person that is has no brain will try to put something like this intro a movie. How this stupid movie even get financed...!!!This is absolutely shocking,While there are a few laughs to be had in this concoction; the disgusting attempts at gross out shocks are not funny or clever or nice. Getting an actress to portray a fifteen year old girl doing a dance at a debutantes ball in which she lifts up her skirt to expose her menstrual bleeding crotch in front of stunned legitimate ball attenders is sick. If Sacha Baron Cohen is trying to satirise himself it might just pass; but as an expose of anyone else it fails miserably. Yuck!,Half of the comedy in this is great; half tasteless; stupid and not funny. However that\\'s just me. To others it might be the opposite. Whoever you are; you\\'ll get a laugh or two out of it. The actor playing his daughter; I hope she gets a bag load of work offers now. She is a good performer.Rudolph Giuliani made an appearance.\\nI think it\\'s time to look up what the fallout has been on that one!,This movie was pathetic. Tons of dirty kindergarden level jokes. Just disgusting. Borat 1 was very funny; it used dark perverted jokes time to time to boost the feel of awkwardness and it felt very natural. Here it feels so forced and fake as if they tried to make it the cringest and most awkward movie ever. I\\'ll admit laughed a bit twice or trice; but as a whole experience it was a torture to watch; I\\'m even embarrassed to admit I\\'ve made it though the whole film.,I stupidly had low expectations on this one. It was hard to believe that a Borat sequel could live up to the first but I was not disappointed. So funny. So original. He\\'s still a comedic genius and you need to watch this film,What a return indeed!Such a great actor in my opinion; I was rolling with laughter!! It had those cringy yet hilarious moments in it that make you laugh out loud.I really appreciate how they portrayed it in such a way as to send a message which is in between the lines so to speak. That truth comes first; and through the spontaneous hilarious outbursts of Borat such secretive \\'hush-hush\\' information is exposed to the public in a manner of ridicule! I enjoyed this one a bit more than the first one for sure!!Definitely deserves a 10/10 from me!!! Great job!!,Complete waste of time; terrible. Liberal tripe. Struggled to watch it all and stay awake; took 3 attempts 8n the hope it might improve; it did not.,It wasn\\'t funny at all. He talks in Hebrew. What\\'s suppose to be funny was disgusting. Don\\'t waste your time!,I laughed a few times; it was OK. First one was much better. The politics were too much; and pretty exaggerated. If your swing far left; sure you\\'ll think it\\'s funny; they\\'ll laugh at any joke if it\\'s making fun of Republicans.,Sachs Baron Cohen is back as the legend Borat. It is offensive; crude but utterly hilarious especially the scene with his daughter after she swallows a baby on a cake; he takes to see if someone can take the baby out of her; after he says it was his fault the baby is in her\\nThis is an upgrade on the last movie,The introduction of the daughter made this sequel terrific. Fast paced with some classic scenes that would sit well within any episode of South Park. As funny as it could possibly get; this a sequel that comfortably matches the first movie,Sequel to 2006\\'s infamous phenomenon Borat; Sacha Baron Cohen returns to his iconic character to shine a light on U.S. politics. You will either be rolling on the floor in laughter throughout or cringing until well after the credits roll. Not an easy moviefilm to recommend to just anyone; but if you enjoyed the first Borat; you will find plenty of laughs here.,Sadly; (and conveniently) released before America heads to the polls; this was nothing but a smear campaign at certain political figures/parties.\\nAnd; although it was funny at times; SBC\\'s Borat character is washed up and just not as hilarious as he once was. Probably because everyone knows what to expect from Borat; taking the original Ali G/Bruno style comedy out of it.\\nIt\\'s worth a watch if you\\'re a fan of Cohen\\'s. However; if you\\'re easily offended by dick and ball jokes; frequent images of male genitalia and anti-semitc banter; sit this one out as you\\'ll just go all Ken and Karen.,1) Has enough comedic moments. The female lead is quite refreshing & saves this film.\\n2) Doesn\\'t take a single shot at the opposite side of the political spectrum. The current hyperprogressive hysteria has limitless potential for effective satire and would have actually been contrarian/edgy but Mr Cohen is actually more Bruno than Borat in real life.\\n3) The infamous Rudy Guiliani scene has some weird repetitive cuts from diffferent angles to make it seem like it\\'s gone on for longer than it does. Whatever it is; it\\'s certainly interesting and you\\'ve gotta give it to SBC for his rather unique brand of shock humor albeit point #2 sets this film back a few significant notches.,Yes some parts are extreme and annoying. But it\\'s entertaining and funny,This would have been a masterpiece if it wasn\\'t clearly politically biased.\\nIf only this had mocked the other side just a little bit; it would have made it a great watch.\\nEven the release date is intended to make it a democrat propaganda material.,I loved the first one. New ideas; new takes on comedy; greatly timed jokes. This one was cringeworthy at best. I grinned once; that\\'s it. Nothing new; just the same old recipe from the previous film - this time spiced with embarrassment. I respect Sacha Baron Cohen. I think his earlier work such as Ali G; Borat; Brüno and The Dictator has been great fun; but this is swing-and-a-miss. I don\\'t see the point of it.\\nA waste of talent; a waste of time and a waste of money. I sincerely hope; he will create something applicable to his talent in the future. This is a mark on his otherwise great comedic competence and reputation.,I loved Cohen\\'s earlier work (Ali G; Borat; Bruno); but this fell way short. The move doesn\\'t have the same feel as his earlier works and I can\\'t say that I laughed a single time during the movie.,As always SBC finds a way for satire without being too heavy handed in directly insulting people. Maria is incredible in her role and can easily hold her own with Sasha which says A LOT!\\nFor me the ending was my favorite part.\\nAnd bad boy Mr. Giuliani! 😂🤣,The best movie I\\'ve seen this year. a great criticism of reality; especially the American way of life and its politicians. I\\'m surprised all those Trump supporters don\\'t give it low marks.,Anyone going into this thinking it wasn\\'t a political movie needs to go watch the Princess Diaries.Well done Baron Cohen; well done on another incredible movie highlighting racism and prejudice.Highly recommend it as it\\'s just 1 1/2 hrs of bonkers by Baron Cohen,I laughed out loud at a handful of scenes. I laugh easily at this type of humor; and I know this.\\nI definitely felt uncomfortable; though; with that last interview. It probably goes too far. I cringed.\\nI get it; there are parts of this country that don\\'t share the same views as the coasts. Some are downright scary when looked at with an evolved sense of humanity. But; to search them out and use them as a representation of a whole party is just flat wrong. You can do this for any group. I wish this movie was more fair and less focused on our politics here. Had these stunts been attempted on all people of varying ideologies you would have had the same results. There are plenty of gullible and flawed people from the diverse spectrum of beliefs out there.\\nI think SBC is better than this but still a comedic genius.,Sequels are never the best; but this one is topping the charts Tutar is simply amazing it cannot get any better than this,What if you continued to belittle half your audience and pandered to less than half of the remainder? maybe boycotting all \" entertainment \" since 2016 is not a bad idea,I wasted 90 minutes watching this totally amateurish movie. Total waste of time. I guess if you thought the first movie was a 10; this will get a 5; so if you thought the first was a 5; this is a zero!\\nDon\\'t waste a minute of your life watching this.,This is what happens when the first movie is a huge success; took much pressure on the second and yes it\\'s a flop!They try to hard to make it funny; Borats jokes and timings are poor!First movie was a documentary style movie; this feels like a normal movie with a story which could be ok; but the acting and punchy jokes were missing.Sometimes just leave movies as they are and don\\'t try and take advantage of all the hype,This film appears to have been made for the sole purpose of trying to influence the American election. It only goes after Trump supporters. I enjoyed the first Borat movie; but as everyone know about Borat now; it\\'s obvious most scenes were scripted and not actual pranks. The movie comes off as racist and arrogant; while trying to appear that the movie is against racism and pushing diversity.,Film was funny. Really disappointed with Tom Hank\\'s performance; though. You could tell his heart was never really in it. He left a lot to be desired. Tom\\'s performance falls somewhere between Angels and Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016). Thomas is a rare taken; indeed; however his shortcomings were truly on display during this cinematic performance. All in and all; 7/10 stars.Oh and Rudy Giuliani touches himself at the end.,Borat saves 2020 and the comedy genre! If you liked the first movie; you will love this one!,It\\'s tough for this movie to live up to the hype of the original which I loved so much but it does a pretty good job. I laughed so hard at times i thought I couldn\\'t breathe. And there were moments of compassion that I wasn\\'t expecting which gave some depth to the movie. Really great and definitely worth the watch. I mean Sacha is a genius and it was a masterpiece,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was a worthy follow up to a first film and i can say that i am glad that this film didnt hold nothing back and it still keeped same style of humor that will offend many people ;but who cares about them;let them cry a river somewhere in a corner of their basements room.Sacha was great again as Borat and he keeped his style through entire film.His daughter was also very funny and she was a great addition to this film;she and Borat shared a lot of great moments together in which one they made fun of everything starting with politicians ;virus and other staff.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was very funny film to me;not on level of first but still very good,Funny movie. Some people say not funny like first one. You make movie in pandemic; then you allowed to judge. Perfect moviefilm to help swallow load of 2020! Very Nice!,Most of the movie was scripted unlike the the first one. Real reactions made the first movie so great and this one didnt have that feeling.,Wow. Just as good as the first. Love the relationship between borat and his daughter. Such great chemistry equals so many laughs,It seems 2020 is going to be the year of watching movies at home; so this is my first \\'home movie\\' review. One of the great things about comedies at the cinema is that you can hear what everyone else thinks of the movie. This is especially the case with a movie like Borat where some of the comedy is very subtle.Anyway overall the second Borat movie is an entertaining watch. At times you do wonder how politically correct some of the humour is; but comedy should push these boundaries. I suppose the stand out moment of the movie is the Rudy Giuliani scene which has got a lot of publicity. I\\'m sure this will have boosted the viewing figures and it doesn\\'t look good. It seems his days of being regarded as one of the hero\\'s of 9/11 are long behind.Whatever your thoughts are on the original Borat film you\\'re pretty certain to feel the same way about this movie.,The first Borat is a timeless classic; you can watch that any time and laugh at the top class satire.\\nBut this one is more of a comedy movie with great laughs here and there; but overall it\\'s just a one time movie with almost no added value for it\\'s social commentary or satire.\\nStill a good movie though.,Haha. Uses deception and misinformation to sway an election. Nice...Just like Russia as the left wing cried. I\\'m not even a Trumpet/GOP fan; but he makes his left wing bias noticeable. His Bias is real to see; and I\\'m a registered independent. Borat is just a washed up Democrat hack now. Other then that. Movie was decent; but not like past before his left wing bias showed. He\\'ll be washed up for a couple years; then you\\'ll probably see another political hit job to rally cry his base. That\\'s what crony capitalism is about. They will all suffer now; since trump bashing won\\'t buy them clicks.,This was never going to be as good as the first one and SBC knows this as he addresses early on in the film that he would need a disguise as the character Borat is to well known to walk arould pranking the unsuspecting public. This is were his daughter ( Maria Bakalova ) comes in to play producing a sterling performance; matching her dad for cringe factor and showing that she has balls as big as SBC.It may not be the best film but In these crazy and sad times an hour and a half of Borat is just what the doctor ordered.,After massive laugh attack of first Borat which imho was great; this second installment feels forced and unfunny from the get go. Storyline is rubbish; acting is bad and it all feels just so hastily glued that we found it to be tiring and barely funny at any point. At somepoint you forgot thinking if this or that scene was completely acted because it did not make you laugh regardless. There was of course the added weight of the political agenda that further made it feel tiring and forced effort. One of the worst movies I have seen in last 10 years.,Genius - a proper laugh and not a disappointment in any way.,Sacha never fails to make you laugh or amaze. He\\'s done it again here. Basically he trolled people and made a movie out of it showing true reactions and candid moments of it. And Maria baklova was an amazing edition here. Even though i wasn\\'t sure anyone could match his spirit of character play which he takes it to extreme ways (which he did in this movie) she could do that too. In the recent interview sacha talked about choosing her from 500 candidates and she was given the script in UK and she has never been to US before yet did a mind-blowing job in the movie with her flawless acting and sacha was actually overshadowed by her performance which is crazy. If she doesn\\'t get an Oscar it\\'s gonna be a shame. Overall controversial and extremely funny and genuine documentary like movie.,I can watch a horror movie almost without flinching because I know it\\'s not real. I can appreciate the art of it. But with this movie; nope. I cover my eyes as I see some of the REAL events unfold in front of me. I\\'m laughing but I\\'m horrified at the same time. How these guys pull off why they do takes courage. ALLOT of courage.,The appeal of this movie is the real moments that our characters find themselves in. This movie; as opposed to the first; actually had a story arc for Borat\\'s daughter that is actually quite compelling at times. The shenanigans that come out of this movie are on point for a SBC flick. Though I will say the viral scene with Rudy G. Is not as controversial as social media might claim.,I love Borat 1 and was extremely excited when they announced a second one but I was left disappointed. The jokes weren\\'t on the same level as the first one and it felt like less risks were taken when filming daring scene for one joke. I think one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie is that there was no Azamat as he was turned into a coach. The story was also really boring and wasn\\'t nearly as stupid or exciting as the first movies. Borat should have gone to another country to learn from them instead of going back to America.,Favorite part: Babysitter Jeanise. Other than that; this movie didn\\'t make me laugh and cringe like the first one did. My reaction to the movie was further solidified by the second-hand embarrassment I felt for Cohen in his interviews and how out of touch he is.,Borat could have been much much better; it was like he was repeated the same jokes again and again; could have been much much better.,I love SCB; he is genius. But I found here he is trying to do some silly comedy. Always trying to be funny dragging unnecessary pervert activity. Felt disturb. Anyway the sarcasm was funny; enjoyed.,This is Borat 2. If you didn\\'t get the humor of the first Borat movie you won\\'t get it here either so don\\'t bother watching or reviewing this. Like the first one; this movie had me laughing at the over-the-top portrayal of a backwards man from a backwards country with a lot of stupid sex jokes and shock-material. I also laughed at the all-to-real backwards Americans with the understanding that a lot of what we are seeing is very cleverly edited to make the dupes seem even more ridiculous. If you read interviews of the dupes from the first movie you realize that all is not as it seems. Hours worth of footage is presented as minute-long encounters in which people say really stupid things or appear to agree with Borat on some very risque subjects. So; TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT! I\\'m sure that we\\'ll hear more stories of how Sasha Baron Cohen and his crew deceived or otherwise bamboozled the people in the movie to act as they did; but we will most likely also conclude that fancy editing aside; some of those people really did say some pretty offensive things. For example; it really doesn\\'t matter how silly a song Borat was singing to the crowd of Texans to make them all look like imbecilic conspiracy theorists; the guy who throws a Nazi salute up is an over-the-top moron.\\nLike the first movie; this one had too many scenes that seem too contrived and a stretch of the imagination in order to shock or get laughs. Some of it just wasn\\'t all that funny to me; but it had plenty of laughs otherwise. All-in-all; it was entertaining and I watched it for free thanks to Amazon Prime.\\nBut wait -- there\\'s more! I have to take issue with the way that the media; Cohen and the production company have portrayed Rudy Giuliani here. I admit that I was a Rudy fan when I lived in New York and was very impressed with the way he conducted himself on 9/11; but I think he\\'s lost his mind with age and has become nothing short of a hand-puppet for the most (the hugist) imbecilic conspiracy theorist; McDonald Trump. That said; I felt manipulated by the footage of Rudy and had to rewind it several times to try to align what I saw with what I read in the press. CNN and the New York Times would have us believe that he was caught making sexy time (or trying to) with Borat\\'s daughter. What I saw was him stupidly agreeing to finish the interview in the bedroom with an attractive; much younger woman and being a bit touchy-feely (patting her on her hip). What I also saw was a quick shot of him trying to get her hair or microphone or something out of a button or zipper on the top of her dress. It appears that we are missing the lead-up to this; like; perhaps; her asking for him to help her get unstuck) making it even more likely that it was edited to make it look like he was unbuttoning her to get her undressed. The press made a very big deal about him laying on the bed putting his hands down his pants ostensibly to touch his penis. What I saw was her taking his microphone unit from the waist of his pants (you can see it in her hand as she lifts her hands from his pants) and then he lays back to tuck his shirt back in; anyone else who is a bit overweight with a larger belly knows that this is an efficient way to get tucked back in. I understand that the Trump administration is a bunch of ass-clowns just asking to be made fun of; but let\\'s at least show the real stupidity of these people without resorting to the very type of fakery that the conspiracy theorists point to as proof that the holocaust never occurred. And stop feeding the extreme left-wing nut-jobs at CNN and the New York Times.,Started with too much excitement but found it disappointing.\\nExcept the daughter\\'s rule book concept; nothing else was funny. The climax was fine but it felt too stretched.,I am a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s previous work as borat and Ali G. It was daring and hilarious because he exposed people in a clever way by pretending to be much dumber than he is.\\nHowever; borat 2 was not a \"great success\" according to me.As soon I saw the trailer; I was both excited but concerned about the casting of his female co star. She did not change my mind since she was came across as annoying and ruined most of the scenes she was in. Also; it seemed she aimed for the ideology; that weird faces and loud noises equals funny. Instead she made it cringe worhty and at times i even had to skip her bits talking in the movie.Sacha Baron Cohen did a better performance; although at many times; he seemed off character such as the rally gig. There were also other times like the mike pence scene where he acts completely different. Therefore; the idea of disguising a disguised person did not work out in this case. I laughed perhaps at 3 occasions throughout the movie which was only Sacha\\'s single scenes.The scripted parts in the movie were terrible and Sacha should have focused on funny pranks instead of monotonous dialogues with Borat\\'s daughter. At times; I felt like I was watching a movie aimed for kids. For example; the ending made was cringe worthy and the combination of vulgarity and childish script gave was terrible.Also; the one sided political aspect of this movie was disappointing. This movie will be irrelevant in five years since its main purpose seemed to focus on the election.,Plot: a Californian with net worth $160m taking pleasure in humiliating peopleThis movie is mostly propaganda focusing on current events and will be forgotten five minutes after the election.,Was amazing seeing the world through the eyes of a woke far left liberal loony; they tried so hard to paint the people who love america as bad but just ended up making them look as mentally unstable as borat! LOL,The movie was terrible. He clearly doesn\\'t have the clout in America anymore; the scenes were chopped up very poorly and the narrative storyline they tried didn\\'t work at all. He really didn\\'t get anyone to say anything provocative or interesting. Clearly many of the scenes are manipulated and forced. Probably his worst film to date. He didn\\'t make any statements about America that are new or reveal anything we don\\'t already know. His interviews sucked and the film was mostly Borat and his \"daughter\" and some guy at a copy machine store. Sacha you have fallen. At least you asked people to get out and vote!,I thought it was funny enough. That scene where he and his daughter were dancing for \"higher society\".... omg my jaw hit the floor and I was peeking out behind hands that covered my eye\\'s.... The ending was an obvious lay down of cards in where Cohen stands politically though. That was a let down. A good 4/10 from me. Not essential viewing; but worth a look in if you\\'re bored.,Too much Kazakh and reading subtitles. Super political. He should have stopped at Bruno.,I don\\'t know what the point of this movie was; I missed the good ol Borat who wasn\\'t afraid to bash anybody; this seemed like a desperate attempt to \\'play it safe\\' but actually; I think this was the end of Borat. I personally prefer the first one; instead of this crap.,There were some funny moments but the movie as a whole wasn\\'t nearly as funny as the first. The basic story takes what would\\'ve been a few jokes about the mistreatment of women in Borat\\'s country previously and makes it a running gag that goes ridiculously far with it. Relies too much on gross out humor. Hard to watch at times. It wasn\\'t even that successful in political figure-damning. At least not how I expected it to be. Not really quotable or re-watchable.,This actor or whatever he is is totally repulsive.,It\\'s ubiquitous that most people are aware of Sacha Baron Cohen and his satire these days.It\\'s been 14 years since the original one and 11 years since Bruno. This satire gets tiresome and cringe once people are aware of the joke and realise in the edit that most of it is not real. It doesn\\'t seem as edgy as the original either. I wanted to like it; but it just wasn\\'t for me. Only an opinion for what it\\'s worth.I give 4/10 for his previous better work like Ali G..,Humour is subjective. However it\\'s arguable that depravity; offence-causing and general crassness requires very little comedic skill. Nothing new was bought to the table here except very obvious political leanings and a quest to belittle those whose views differ. I say this as someone who has very little interest in politics in general; so I don\\'t have a viewpoint or dogma to defend. I just think there should be balance in everything; especially if art is a vehicle through which society can heal. That\\'s why Bill Burr is such a legend as he mocks everyone!,No this was anything but Borat. It starts off at a vulgar tone and ends with the same. I had to skip many parts due to this. It was painful to watch. This was a political satire done in worst possible way. If you were looking for comedy; forget about it; all you are going to get is watching pubic hairs and butt *oles. There\\'s hardly anything of note. A movie done in haste. In fact seems no real effort was put in.\\nDisappointed,Offensive\\nDisrespect for beliefs (this is not a critique)\\nRepeating jokes from 14 years ago\\nYes; this is not a comedy!\\nThe propaganda of the left wing and the Democrats and its publication a few days before the US elections\\nAlas; the talents serve the political factions,Gave it a 10 just to even out all the bad reviews from the Trump worshipers. It is a very funny movie For opened minded people! If you are a Trump lover you probably should just skip it along with 99% of all movies due to the fact nobody relevant in Hollywood supports him. Also it\\'s hard not to compare to the first one but try to.,As most sequels; this one is lacking that touch of originality. The actress playing his daughter Tutar is good. Borat is not always convincing but there are several funny and many cringeworthy scenes. Unfortunately; the scenes with Pence and Giuliani did not work and not funny. Overall; a mediocre export from Kazakhstan.,As my review title says it is kind of feast or famine with Borat 2. Some of the pranks were great; but some were just plain not funny. Without giving spoilers it\\'s hard to describe. The only thing I will say is the o e that was leaked about Rudy was creepy; but clearly he was tucking his shirt after taking off the mic. If anyone say anything different you are a dope. The first movie was revolutionary the second one was not.,Looks terrible and I only watched the trailer first one was good this is desperate and so bad looking,Whoever says this one isn\\'t better than the first clearly got lost. It\\'s just masterful how Sacha was able to pull this off being that everyone knows him; there was a pandemic and shutdown. And the cherry on all of this was Rudy Giuliani who didn\\'t know about his involvement to the film until the very week it was released. Also he made himself look extremely creepier than usual. The female actress was a true rock star. Yes this was better than the first one. 10/10,Great to see the character return but this film was poorly executed and only had a couple of funny moments.,I laughed for an hour and a half and now my cheeks hurt. A similar taste to Cohen\\'s previous movies; but perhaps with a more sober tone towards the end. And more so as the credits ended.,This is a very irreverent movie on many levels; people who enjoy irreverent movies will generally love this one because of the inventiveness. Unless you are a Trump fan.There is a made-up reason for Borat\\'s mission to the USA; to deliver his 15-yr-old daughter as a bride; in the end he realizes he was sent there to spread the virus that caused COVID-19. He and his daughter (actress actually about 23 during production) run a series of scams; perhaps the most interesting with Rudy Giuliani in a hotel room because it currently (Oct 2020) is making the rounds in various news outlets. He was taken in totally by the scam of being interviewed by a cute; inexperienced foreign reporter; touching her affectionately; afterwards going to the bedroom for a drink; then appearing to pleasure himself with his hand down his pants. But probably just tucking his shirt in; as he claims. It is very funny if you are not on the receiving end of the joke.Anyway overall I found it to be a well made and very funny movie; mostly making fun of Trump and his supporters. If I were a Trump fan I\\'d likely react very differently. I watched it on Amazon streaming via my Roku.,It\\'s not as good as the 1st but still good. There were a few parts that I thought were poor and not funny but a fair few parts had me howling. 6.5/10,It\\'s not as good as the first one; but still really enjoyable and funny. And the twist at the end is just brilliant. ^^,Lame; boring; stupid and disgusting. Will rot your mind and make you stupider than Tweety.,Utterly brilliant film. The first film had such a great impact and managed to fool so many people you\\'d think that he wouldn\\'t be able to do it again; but he did. Had me in hysterics most of the time. Its so clever how he manages to convince so many Americans to believe the act.\\nSacha baron Cohen is a master,Sacha is an absolute legend..he pulled it off again; but just better,This movie was better than the other one. The jokes are out of the doubt. I can\\'t say he made me laugh too much; though.,It blew. I tried. I watched it with an open mind. Didn\\'t work. Watched it again with an altered mind. Still....nada.....and I think Kevin Smith movies are masterpieces and Broken Lizard films are Oscar-worthy. That\\'s how badly this steaming pile of a diaper fire is.It\\'ll probably go down in history as the biggest cult classic since Reefer Madness.I\\'d ask for my money back but it was part of my subscription.,If borat didn\\'t have TDS in the first movie it\\'s clearly got stage 4 TDS now.,The charm of the first movie was that you could never tell when people were in on the joke or genuine candid people. This movie had maybe one good moment like that; but never really hit the sweet spot. None of the jokes really hit like the first one. It felt lazy and forced. yay it\\'s fun to make fun of republicans I guess; but you have to at least make it funny. The movie literally ends this \"Go vote\" if that tells you the reason this movie was made and released when it was. Spoiler alert: it wasn\\'t for fans who\\'ve been excited for another Borat movie for years.\\nCost me $0 to watch and still wasn\\'t worth it.,Borat is back ! This may not pack the punch of the first movie; but it sure does deliver on its topical message told through Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s very unique comedy style.\\nNot for the faint hearted; it will almost certainly offend the intellectually challenged Gun Totin\\' Conservative Americans; Evangelicals; etc...........This is; in essence; a sharp parody of all thats been bad in America for the past few years.I found it hilarious.,Reason for 1 rating (lowest) - I think the way they portrayed a 15 year old girl and the exposure is in very poor taste in the name of comedy. Not worth the watch.,This is a disgusting movie with blasphemy. The movie started a bit funny and it touches politics way too much. Its It\\'s actually all about politics. They played around with a very sensitive topic which is abortion in a very unsensitive; disgusting way. This film is a punch in the stomach for all women. Is just disgusting. My husband and I we decided to stop watching the movie in the scene where the girl is dancing and her dress is all cover in blood due to her menstruation. An absolute disgusting scene that seriously should be prohibited.,Some funny scenes but all in all just an eh. This guy needs to just go away already. But when you are in the \"club\"; you are in the club and once in the club one can continue to suck for a while and still make movies.,Sacha you have done it again!! The icing on the cake for me was Guiliani\\'s October surprise,More than half the skits were fake.; Borat is the only funny guy in the whole movie and he is not as good as he was in the first one because everyone knows him in the US.; I love the first one but this one has no rewatch value and it\\'s just disgusting.,Unntural foreign garbage.You think it\\'s funny that we live for our country; guns ans country? Then the joke\\'s on you. A relation between a father and a daughter is their affair and protected by the constitution. So there.\\nHail President Trump.,I watched it free to air on Solar Movies website (where you can watch tens of thousands of movies for free).. Compared to the first movie; this one was very tame. I do not regret watching it; I found it entertaining; but I found it slow and really lacking in humor.In reality; no way could Sacha Baron Cohen repeat the earlier classic and certainly not expect it to be better;. The shock factor is long gone.I really considered this one as mediocre.,The second part has some funny moments but cannot reach the level of the first one. Maybe because people already have high expectations and also due to some repetitions. Overall; it is a fun movie to watch (not many funny movies coming lately from Hollywood).but it somewhat more predictable.,I think no one should stoop to such a low level of making a movie like this. It\\'s a scripted and professionally filmed movie that supports a few scenes designed to shock you and \\'uncover\\' something about others.\\nIn reality; what happens is that Borat exploits other people\\'s friendliness; openness and patience while insulting them with pubertal humor; having a camera crew in the bushes hoping for an improper reaction.\\nHe does tricks from his older content; such as showing up and identifying with a group of people;appearing foreign and well-meaning; but then twisting the content more and more towards very inappropriate. It was funny back then; but this time around almost no one got fooled or reacted to any of his jokes; even though he tried harder and harder to shock. And when making something like a self proclaimed political commentary; with interviews of real people in a false context; I don\\'t think this is an okay way of doing it. The \\'shocking\\' scene at the end was a beautiful woman talking about how starstruck she was; flirting with that Rudy guy; then pulling him into a bedroom. Then Borat comes in yelling that she was 15; when in fact she was 24; playing a serious adult role of reporter; nothing like the more childish daughter role of earlier in the movie. Like some episode of how to catch a predator. There wasn\\'t anything revealed there even. I don\\'t know; I think it\\'s tasteless and whatever story they are trying to serve it\\'s viewers I think most would find it counter-productive to that.,The first half is funny but gross-out cringey (and socially and politically no-holds barred). The second half is genius.,Sacha Baron Cohen has hilarious blown open the undeniable corruption of America\\'s currently politics and called out all those who are complicit with it. Never has anything so educational made me laugh so much.Please watch this - it\\'s message is so important. Not only are bad men undeniably exposed for who they really are; but a glimpse is given into the hope and the good that America could be.,Not as funny or charming as the first movie; but still better than anything else around at the moment. This time the target(s) of his humour are almost entirely Republicans and the right; which became a bit tiresome; though I\\'d love to know the full SP on the Giuliani scene. What really kept this film afloat was Borat\\'s daughter (Maria Bakalova ); she really owned the role and ran away with it; I don\\'t think I\\'ve been so impressed with a new actor in many years; she was fantastic I hope we see more from her soon.,Sasha Baron Cohen dusts off the grey suit for a second run as Borat Sagdiyev; fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film. If you saw the 2006 film you know what to expect; satire and social commentary turned up to 11. Cohen still employs his heavy-handed approach to making very nuanced comments on modern society; all wrapped in cringe-inducing humor. Seeing people agree with and feel emboldened by his use of stereotypes that create a safe space for bigotry and misogyny show the audience how prevalent hate still is in the world. Cohen again holds a mirror up to society and creates laughs for those already in on the truth.81/100,1st borat movie was very good and funny.\\n2nd borat movie a complete disaster to the point where my son 17 years old did not finish it.\\nNo where near as funny as the first borat\\nWhat a waist of money and energy really...,Borat again delivers comedy in very awkward situations as he exposes America in the most humorous way possible. A lot of shocking moments. Definitely worth the watch. It is not as good as the first one but definitely just as shocking.,Excellent. Breath of fresh air from PC nonsense that is typically made today. Extra stars just for having the courage to make this film in the current political climate,Honestly; I was so waiting to see this movie; but I must say that it was very weak compared to the previous version!,Kind of disappointing to read conservatives\\' ratings just calling the film juvenile and not funny. Did they just not get it? This is satire; and since there appears to be confusion somehow: Cohen does not hate Jews or women; or even the Q Anon guys he lived with for 5 days. He said they were simply good; normal people who had just been fed a diet of lies. He\\'s a good man and a funny one at that. Why are you so upset that bigotry and hate is being called out for what it is in this film?Just look no further than the current president if you want to criticize someone for being so morally bankrupt; a man who thinks he can grab women\\'s crotches whenever he wants. It\\'s a shame that any man would defend this twisted power trip.Giuliani is a creep; and it\\'s on tape. Like the president; he loves women laughably younger than him; and cheating on their spouses is just second nature to them (hm... seems pretty common with politicians in general; though. Hi; Bill; hello Mr. Weiner).But I really can\\'t understand defending this embarrassing president and trashing any movie that makes you feel like your supposed political sensibilities are offended. You know who\\'s not offended by this film? People who don\\'t identify as Nazis; and also people who understand what. satire. is. Borat is a character and does not reflect the actual views of Cohen... he is a vessel to expose anti-Semitism; racism; sexism; and so many things that hurt human beings.,To be honest; I\\'m not a fan of Cohen\\'s brand of comedy. That said; his past films exposed people in power for greed and racism. This time he pranked really good people; the kind babysitter; the Christian Counselor and the Jewish ladies. I thought that was in very poor taste.Frankly this film made me cringe so many times it was hard to watch. I know he\\'s going for shock value but it repulsed me.,Some funny scenes but not even close to as good as the original. Like a 16 year old wrote it. Lots of repetitive and corny jokes.,Much better then the first one. this one actually had some writers and a point to it. but still cringe and border idiotic. pathetic idea ; pathetic characters; cringe supreme.,I am a huge fan of the original Borat. I\\'ve seen it about 60 times. I had high hopes for this and it paid off. With 2020 being the worst year EVER; we needed a good movie to cheer everyone up. Borat did that and made us all get a good laugh. Not as good of the first; but no one was expecting it to be as good. To sum it up for everyone; WATCH THIS MOVIE. Watch it especially if you loved the first. 8.5/10,Borat 1 is classic; its well made with a story and most importantly it made me lauge. This one failed in every category. I would not recommend it to anyone.,Awful; meaningless; nasty; disgusting and terrible!! It is not funny at all. I am deeply sorry for the such meaningless script. I do not want to think more about this movie!,I really liked this part; it wasnt as good as the first one but it had a lot to say; YAKSHAMAY,I couldn\\'t bear watching more than half of it ; and it was the first time for me not to watch a movie to the end. Absolutely disgusting and aweful!,All I have to say in in the title. Sorry if this is too short.,Sacha Baron Cohen goes above and beyond to make his point and bring the truth forth and the timing couldn\\'t have been more perfect for this movie to come out.,Probably the most important political satire of our time. It\\'s bold; brutal and disheartening.,Karen killed Fauci.\\nNow go vote or you will be execute!,Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s best work yet.I haven\\'t laughed so loudly for a while.Whilst this is at times extremely uncomfortable viewing the message that he is sending is crystal clear and very much of the moment. Hilarious yet chilling at the same time.,Probably just as funny as the first one. Didn\\'t stops laughing the whole time. Not for tge squeamish though! 😂😂😂,After watching the 1st Part \"Borat\" over a decade ago; I always wanted a 2nd part and after 14 long years finally it is here. An amazing movie and not to be taken in a wrong way. It is just for fun.,Saha reminded me with Peter Sellers on his way of acting especially when he is descising; a little bit from the pink panther strikes back..\\nIts a nice movie to watch over all,Very funny as expected; though they took liberties with certain scenes.,I was hyped once I learned another Borat was coming out. I had seen the right rally concert leaked and thought it was hilarious; couldn\\'t wait to see the whole deal.The trailer also looked hilarious. Sadly the trailer basicly spoiled the whole movie as it had all the best jokes in it; the trailer even had stuff the movie didn\\'t. The right rally gig wasa big disappointment as the movie was more focused on the scripted plot than showing borat trolling Trump supporters. The leaked video filmed with a phone was miles better as it only shows borat singing.Do NOT watch the trailer and you might find the movie a lot funnier.,It was a good watch for the most part although it was just not near as funny as the original borat; the performance from sacha baron cohen wasn\\'t a good one in comparison to the original borat.You should watch it though its still decent but really not as good as the OG borat,I think I actually lost brain cells watching the first 20 minutes of this movie. One would have to have an EXTREMELY warped and demented sense of humor to enjoy this film.,I don\\'t know what high school deranged farm humour this is.A few chuckles here and there. Big waste of time.Might as well watch any schumer,This movie has so much comedy and heartwarming moments that it makes you forget to realise how amazing the films writers are that they were able to adapt so well to the current pandemic situation to give this movie even more of that tasty realism and make this a true Borat movie,Amazing work by Sacha and team; Maria looks pretty. All characters have given justice to their roles.,Yes I rated it a 10 to help offset the morons voting it a 1/10. But it\\'s truly a 7 for me. Classic Borat punch lines with some definite cringe moments;as expected. Nice little twist at the end. It was not as political as some reviews state. Yes there\\'s politics it\\'s pokes fun at both the left and right but it\\'s about the humour. Have to check it out if you\\'re a Borat fan!,Didn\\'t disappoint. It\\'s everything that we expected.,Big disappointment! After waiting 14 years the public and fans deserved better. The humor was weird like not meant to be funny but more for the shock factor. Very disappointed.,Considering the level of fame Sacha Baron Cohen and his characters have achieved it\\'s absolutely incredible that he was able to pull off something like this... Smart; hilarious and shockingly absurd.,I didn\\'t really think I was going to enjoy this Borat revival; but I was quietly optimistic; given the generally positive reviews circulating online. I have in hindsight realised that they were speaking well of this film not for the humour (which is crass and lazy for the most part); but for its political commentary on the current state of the USA. Despite this; Borat is still far from a good film; leaning on some terrible comedy and its reputation for commercial success.In a similar vein to its predecessor; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a film that mocks itself; belittling genders; races and personal beliefs over the meagre 1.5 hour runtime. I know this is the point; but it doesn\\'t make watching any easier: particular jokes (one aimed at the Jewish community and another based around female puberty) were actually painful to witness; getting more of an embarrassed response than anything else. Behind these set pieces were some legitimately clever moments and even some properly written gags; but it wouldn\\'t be worth sitting through the dreg to get to them.In spite of this; the clever aspect of Borat is in his unassuming nature. By being naive and clueless (and at times extremist in his views); he lulls Americans into a false sense of security; which allows some insightful moments. My personal favourites included managing to extricate a Nazi salute from a Republican voter; whilst another showed the brutally honest misogyny of a southern man at a Debutante Ball. There is technically a \"story\" to this film as well; but it\\'s a stretch to call it worth paying attention to. Something that really irked me was the excessive green-screening used: clearly the budget did not extend to sending the cast and crew all over the globe; but not even having the energy to build a low-budget set on-site just looks careless to me.All in all; Borat was not good. It wasn\\'t very clever; it wasn\\'t very funny; but more than anything; it didn\\'t tell me anything about the crazy parts of the USA I didn\\'t already know. In reality; you\\'d be better off watching the Youtube channel \"All Gas No Brakes\" - political humour; whilst leaving the crass jokes at the door.,What a sell out.Not funny; politically motivated; offensive to people who don\\'t deserve to be mocked,Movie would have been a great success without women partlcipatong in it. Rudy was made out to lool like a good guy; which he is not. Shame on you Sasha Baron Cohen. Oh how you have fallen since Ali G.,After working in the industry for so long Borat has become a very well known face. First Borat was released when social media and youtube wasnt really a thing. People didnt have smartphones. Today its much more difficult to make this movie without getting recorded by fanboys or strangers. I wasn\\'t really expecting it to be as great as first one but given current time it delivered everything that first movie had.It could be less scripted but to be honest that would be quite impossible in a time when everyone has a smartphone. I am surprised he was able to perform this well.I am not going to release any details but definitely worth watching.Watch it now!,Sacha Baron Cohen and the other girl who acted as his daughter have done a wonderful job. But Larry Charles could have done much better just like he entertained us with crude humor and offensive comedy as in the prequel of this film.,Sacha Baron Cohen revisits his most famous character in what feels like another in a long line of tired retread comedies. What was groundbreaking 15 years ago is now a tad uninspired. Sure; there are a handful of good chuckles... However; the main takeaway from this film is that the red half of America is one of the least educated (verging on mentally challenged) basket of deplorables in the world. But again... Everyone already knew that.,Same same same ... Shows the structural problems in the US; but a bit boring. Has a good ending.,Borat\\'s anticipated return was epic when I first learned of it! But I always knew it would never be as good as the original. I hoped it would at least be good; but I prepared for the worst. It had its moments; but overall was a let-down. There was way too much focus on Borat\\'s daughter. I didn\\'t watch this for her! I want to watch a Borat movie for the man himself! Would I recommend you watch this? Yes. But only if you have an hour and a half to spare and you don\\'t fancy watching anything else. Aside from that; don\\'t rush to see this,The film was not as side-splittingly hilarious as the first one; but perhaps that\\'s just because the ridiculousness of \"everyday Americans\" has already been so exposed in all forms of media that it is no longer shocking.Still a sharp satire with some funny moments; worth a watch.,Not as funny as original I think they waited to long fir a 2nd movie there was some laughs the whole movie no,Maybe i had 2 3 laughs but i already saw those moments on youtube so .. meh,This film has a few moments of comedy. Otherwise; it is pure Hollywood propaganda. I went into the film having seen the first; but knowing very little about the sequel. I should have used context clues to decipher the sole purpose of the film.... to influence voting. The film ends with the text \"now vote; or be executed\". This was strategically released a little over a week before the election in an attempt to sway public opinion. It failed. Even as a comedy; this film was full of old tropes and overplayed stereotypes. Watch at your own risk; but be prepared to be let down.Cohen succeeds at very little in this film. It is a reminder that he is a one trick pony and is more of an activist than an actor. Any acclaim for this film will be on purely political grounds. Hard pass.,The original was a classic but this is a poor sequel. The jokes aren\\'t as funny; the characters aren\\'t as strong; the whole thing comes across as desperate.\\nIn a couple of years people will admit that this movie sucks.,The very satirical and current nature of Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is what makes it good. Republicans will be literally swearing at the TV.HOWEVER; this is counterbalanced with some overly contrived scenes; a little to heavy reliance on shock comedy moments and a bit of a pacing issue l; which is never a great sign for a film with such a short running time.I love Sacha Baren Cohen and most of his work; but this one felt like a step too far in the wrong direction to be anything more than a semi-watchable footnote in his Filmography in 3-5 years from now.,God did I need to laugh and I did. Especially loved the storyline spoofing patriarchal culture and Melania\\'s golden cage. The debutante ball punk couldn\\'t have been any funnier. And then there was the crashing of some kind of republican ladies\\' affair. Kudos to Borak\\'s costar who was superb!,Hilarious and brillant of you like dark Humor. A very good sequal to the Match changing first Borat Film of 2006.,Not quite as many shocking moments and more focus on the story compared to the first but the climate that Sacha has to do this in was insane with the virus going on. It\\'s hard not to look at the original with nostalgia but still pretty damn good.,The humour was not there this time around; everything was so predictable.,Borat and the girl did great. This puts a smile on my face. I am a fan since the firsf one came out 12 years ago and i can say that this one is as good. 👍👍,I love it as much as the first one if not even more!\\nIt\\'s amazing the actress was hilarious; I love it . I\\'m looking to see more of her . I hope there it\\'s a Borat 3 .\\nI highly recommend. I will keep my monthly subscription to amazon just for this one ; looove it .,This movie was awesome. Huge that the super serious Trumpers have such a hard time finding the humor in it all.,The film is a very quick watch that really does not take itself seriously at all. Some bits are downright hilarious but others are only mildly entertaining. The plot which holds together all the bits is not very strong; not that anyone expected it to be. It\\'s a decent film that may have been better in a YouTube format.,There\\'s a few really funny scenes; otherwise it was pretty boring. I understand it was probably hard to do since everyone knows who he is now; but there wasn\\'t any really shocking moments except the Daddy Daughter dance lol.,Same borat humor but whoever did the HDR edit of the movie did not watch it. 30% of scenes are to dark to see what\\'s going on. Reminded me for the last episode of game of thrones,I loved Borat and I even loved parts of this movie too. All the political satire; the jokes on women and jews; everything was great. But it felt a little like Saturated Borat because they added a character of his daughter. It was not a \\'Borat\\' movie. You can say that even in the first part there was a reporter with him. But still it was a \\'Borat\\' movie. In this movie; the girl has been given too much time on screen and that saturated the regular Borat a bit. It\\'s my opinion. If you think the same then like the review.Cheers.,When Sacha Baron Cohen puts on his mask; he removes everyone else\\'s. Often mistaken for mere racist caricatures; his stereotypical characters serve to confirm the biases of his unwitting documentary subjects (usually the voting American public and sometimes the very officials they\\'ve elected); effectively catfishing them into revealing even uglier sides of themselves.Unfortunately; his character of Borat is too well-known (and over-quoted) to make another pseudo-realist \"prank film\" without getting caught. That is; at least under the Borat Sagdiyev moniker (even as his latest film was produced pretty secretively). What if; oh I dunno... Borat himself was to put on disguises?As confirmed by 2018\\'s Who is America; Cohen does still know how to dupe voters; celebs; and public figures into unleashing their worst selves; and this extra-layered bit of trickery is no exception. Following the early screenings; Cohen\\'s latest prank was already making headlines; having caught cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani in the act of doing something not-much-better than that which he himself has attempted to ruin the Biden family for.In the movie; Borat\\'s near-feral and supposedly underaged daughter; Tutar (Maria Bakalova); joins the Kazakhstani reporter on his second trek to the United States; meeting such figures as Mike Pence and the aforementioned Giuliani on the way. Thing is; since Giuliani is one of Cohen\\'s victims; he is not a part of the film\\'s fiction (the same way Borat and his daughter are) - thus; when taking Tutar\\'s in-universe age as fact and nevertheless \"enjoying\" her in his sleeping quarters; he isn\\'t acting. Even if you don\\'t share Cohen\\'s biases; Giuliani having this sort of kerfuffle is a gloriously poetic bit of comedy.I don\\'t know that this boner (pun intended) will delegitimize criticisms of the Biden family; but I feel a great swell of pity for Giuliani; mainly because his top defenders include Mike Cernovich; ever selective with when he chooses to call out pedophilia (jokes on Twitter is usually what does it; not the actual act). In a defense of Giuliani; Cernovich asked why we don\\'t investigate Cohen - who; in the same footage; also seemed to believe Bakalova was no more than 15 and still made it possible that Giuliani brought her to his bed (by writing it so that Tutar will do anything to become \"next Queen Melania\").First of all; the actress isn\\'t actually 15. Second of all; Cohen was in-character as Borat; who does have a 15-year-old daughter in the form of the character portrayed by said actress. The only party who conceivably believed that Tutar was a real-life minor is the politician who tried to f-ck her; i.e. the person currently being defended by \"righteous; free-thinking reporters\".Basically; Cohen continues to stand out among contemporary comics. Matt Zoller Seitz summarized the film\\'s mission as \"positioning its hero as a depraved; narcissistic fool whose flaws and excesses mirror his clueless targets\\' so closely that they don\\'t realize they\\'re being made fun of; even when Cohen stops just short of hauling out a sign that reads; \\'YOU ARE THE JOKE\\'.\" He also eloquently describes the film\\'s ultimate point on America: \"For all its posturing as The Greatest Nation on Earth; the United States circa 2020 has more in common with a retrograde foreign backwater than its government or people like to admit.\"Much of Cohen\\'s Borat shtick has always been about how; on top of pretending to affirm the beliefs of bigots; the bogeyman said bigots like to rail against isn\\'t that far removed from themselves (in terms of how they view gender roles or religion or whatever); which becomes especially obvious when they actually start BONDING with the Borat figure. Notice how I\\'ve gone this far without mentioning mankinis or goofy catchphrases (or the beautifully idiotic way in which Borat combats the Coronavirus). Just so the detractors (and certain fans) are clear that there\\'s more to this IP than they realize.,Waste of time! Not even funny. Loved the first movie. But this one was absolute trash.. just wanted some comedy with out the politics.,Borat 2006 was great; until it found out to be mostly scripted with a few real gags.Borat 2020 is undeniably mostly scripted. There is no ways Cohen would be able to get away with what he does without being sued.,I\\'m so glad we finally got a sequel; this is something everyone wanted but that couldn\\'t be done because everyone already knew about Borat at that point.This was the perfect movie that we needed during the pandemic and It\\'s a masterpiece,The film started slow and ended very slow and at the end could not make head nor tail out of it. The first part was a fantastic movie but this was a disappointment. Even the picturization is so dull and gloomy even in outdoor shots. Content is good but the story line and is awful.,If you like the first your going to watch it.. just taper your expectations because its nowhere as good. Mostly scripted and a lot less candid humor.,Here is a huge 10 from me;to the man with balls of steel. I didn\\'t expect anything;especially not to live up to the first movie. Yes there are some parts that are maybe dragged out or could be replaced with other pieces to be more funny and dynamic;but all in all the movie is brilliant. It is another type of Borat movie.\\nAs for the political views i might not exactly share them with Sacha as i do not live in the West;but since when should that stop appreciating genius comedy ?\\nSacha has done it again !,Although I may be a minority voice I feel this wasn\\'t a touch on the original film.\\nCohen has always been quite political in nature. Irrespective he has largely subverted his views and let the comedy speak for itself. With the exception of a handful of laughs I found it depressingly obvious where he was headed. For all those not old enough to have watched Da Ali G Show on Channel 4 in the UK it was a surprising mix of both highbrow and lowbrow comedy loaded into a tightly spoken paraphrase. He didn\\'t care who he made fun off it crossed all political and non political boundaries. Now unfortunately I think he is only happy to be politically incorrect when it validates his political correctness to left learning audiences. I\\'d still be happy to watch his next attempt; but please don\\'t dumb it down for your audience.,Possibly the least funny movie I\\'ve ever seen! Worse than Ishtar if anyone is old enough to remember that flop,A very disappointing movie all round...\\nMostly staged; everything note worthy covered in the trailer. It was always going to be hard to do a sequel and honestly they should have not gone through it.\\nCouple of of laughs throughout but generally not funny and predictable,Lied to her to take part in a \"Documentary\" and massively underpaid her.,Very demeaning for women. objectifying women. Some of the content is funny though.,This film has officially usurped my favorite comedy \\'Neighbors;\\' the Belushi one not the recent one.\\nSacha manages to spin several subs themes and spins them all to a perfect conclusion that shows the absurdity of each one.\\nThe performance by Maria is absolutely unbelievable and I wish I had a girl like her around when I was raising he*l in my younger days. She is ice cold and doesn\\'t miss a beat.\\nFew people give Sacha the respect he deserves....he is absolutely brilliant.\\nBTW. Wanna discover if you are a truly independent thinker or just one who\\'s desperate to belong to a side.....\\nI have the answer for you. IF YOU ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS; YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT THINKER.\\nIF NOT; YOU ARE A MORON SEEKING TO BELONG TO a GROUP. Nothing more; nothing less!\\nThat\\'s true for both sides of the political spectrum.,Some genuinely funny moments which isnt easy as its a reheated formula. Some scenes were not so nice as cohen seemed to exploit innocent and nice people. The rudy scene in the hotel while news media blockbuster was a complete honey trap. Yes overall the guy is a sleaze bag. But constantly touching him on the knee and buttering him up seductively before inviting him into the bedroom for a drink. She pulled his shirt up unmiking him; leaving him needing him to tuck back in. No doubt he thought he was onto an sexual encounter but only because she led him strongly to feel that way. Why barge in; why not let the camera keep rolling and really catch him in an expose. Cohan always takes the easy option with easy targets. Its funny at times but not serious movie making. Candid camera on steroids. I almost felt sorry for guiliany and thats saying something considering his lack of character.,I like Sasha and his movies. I am not sure I enjoyed this one. It was mostly fake and I could see it. With previous movies; there was way more real content. I get it; everyone knows borat these days so it\\'s hard to find clueless people. It\\'s just 95% of the content was fake/staged. The joke lines were not bad;especially in the beginning;but by middle; there was very little.,The original Borat film for a masterpiece. Sacha Baron Cohen is; to me; the best comedian of his generation along with Dave Chappelle. The problem with this sequal was that it was very far between the hilarous moments. Yes; a lot of it was funny in the case that it could make you smile a little; but there was only like one or two scenes that made you burst out in laughter. In comparison; the first Borat film was completely hilarious all throughout. I had quite big expectations for this sequel; and when the closing credits came up I just sat there feeling oddly disappointed. Obviously a must watch for many reasons; but don\\'t expect a masterpiece; because it isn\\'t one.,Hilarious; raunchy and the humorous side of the absolute worst of humanity! Just as much of a classic as the original.,All I can say as it hits all the notes! I hope we get to see more of Sasha in the near future! Bring Back Ali G Baby!!,Underwhelming but funny... not as funny as the 1st borat but it\\'s great to see some political commentary I guess.. Still pretty funny and topical but doesn\\'t get anywhere close to the first borat.,It was funny at times but the surprise factor of Baron-Cohen being able to play a character which; back then in the first film; wasn\\'t recognised as being Baron-Cohen pranking people; was obviously gone in this film. It constantly made me think which scenes were real and which ones were staged? I honestly believe most of the scenes were scripted this time. I think the people involved weren\\'t actors; but most of the scenes must have been scripted. I mean you could basically just see it by the bad acting! Except probably for the public scenes during the \\'anti-covid\\' rally; the CPAC conference and the interview with Guiliani. But this just made the story a bit weaker in my opinion. On the other hand; the scenes where those American yanks were just basically making a fool out of themselves were entertaining nevertheless! 😏,Although I\\'d love to review this with rose-tinted glasses I\\'m not going to. I laughed about 25 times during this movie which isn\\'t terrible but it just isn\\'t up to par with the First Movie.\\nSome scenes were flat out disgusting. The Hall/Period Scene was This movie at it\\'s lowest point. It\\'s a 5 out of 10,Borat is the biggest POS I have ever watch. This isnt funny just a stupid film to help the millennias deal with life.,I guess people will do anything for money now a days.. 1st one was just plain dumb this one is even dumber. When he tried to dress up as Trump; he didn\\'t look anything like him and he didn\\'t even try to sound like him.,Watching this from Australia I\\'m glad everyone can finally see how inward looking America really is . United States ? Yer right ....Great movie ; very funny ; gotta love the Cinderella cartoon rip off lol,Funny. I enjoyed it. Can\\'t wait to watch it again.,I went in expecting this movie to be worse than the first one; becausw let\\'s face it that how usually films are; but it was by far worse than i ever thoight. There were some funny scenes; but i only laughed maybe three times. It all looks forced and honestly; it is the worst Cohen production i ever watched. It is not an age thing either; \"Who is America\" was made just one or two years ago and it was hilarious. This looks like it was written and filmed very fast just for the sake of filming it.Should you watch it? Honestly; don\\'t. If you are a major fan; especially then. Better go watch \"Who is America\".,Another excellent movie from Sacha Baron Cohen. As a father I loved Borat\\'s acting with his \"daughter\" Tutar; and have watched it 3 times.The rehearsed dancing; music; jokes; entertaining scenes and THAT usual shocking scene from Sacha will make you jump and get excited like you are watching a thriller.Great Success!,Sasha as Borat does it again. Less is more almost. Less meetings but more massive the shock and cringe and exposé he makes of the deep underbelly of good and bad in America and American politics. I surprised he didn\\'t get arrested with his \"daughter\". Imagine if Rudy Guliani sued them and the judge said ok \"play the tape\"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,Being a huge fan of Borat; I was anticipating for this film. Cliche jokes; (cell phone and facetime puns; in 2020? Really?); bad scripting; and an unimaginative plot; didn\\'t do the trick for me. Felt way too forced and way too much political. I understand he wanted to do an anti-Trump movie; and release it before the elections; but this is Borat. This is not the Cohen TV show. Borat is a figure that we enjoyed world wide and was the sarcasm of the capitilistic West and the former Soviet; looking for a modern identity; wannabe capitalistic but still Soviet East. He could have made an anti-Trump TV movie instead; and promote it as such; and yes; then; it would be funny and great. But for a Borat movie; an international release; it\\'s a NO.,There was some funny bits but if you\\'re not American or interested in American politics it\\'s a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one. The first one was about Borat and his crazy adventures; this one was about current American politics with Borat. Might have been funnier as a series rather than a movie.,It\\'s pretty clear that the character hasn\\'t been practiced and that it\\'s almost like he\\'s doing an impression of him own character. That what happens when you leave something like this for so long.There are a few funny bits but it\\'s pretty disappointing of your expecting the old Borat.,Feels a bit too fake; and nobody in the film even gets that upset. Da Ali G Show was amazing; because you could tell he was simply sitting in a room with REAL people and they had no idea they were a part of the joke.\\nI enjoyed the first Borat film; but this one just feels too unrealistic to me. It\\'s possible the bits were all with people who had no idea this was Sacha Baron Cohen; but i sincerely doubt it. The dialogue and things people say seem much more rehearsed than bits on Da Ali G Show.Sure; the social commentary is interesting; and I like that Cohen still doesn\\'t shy away from any topic. But the \"shock value\" in this film consists of a lot of gross/ridiculous scenes with him & his daughter; where the meat & potatoes of Borat should be his interactions with everyday people. Just my $.02 on a mostly forgettable movie.,This wasn\\'t bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive;racist;dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea; they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion; they could\\'ve waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie; because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing.,Mostly funny especially the political parts otherwise ok,Borat was a phenomenon. Now it has to be referred to as \"the first Borat\" because of this sub-par sequel. Everything is predictable and on the nose; and the unpredictable parts are just plain stupid. We all deserved better.,I loved the movie; wow I love Sasha\\'s movies; and this one was no different; I laughed a lot; the guy is great; speechless for this movie; everything I said will be little to praise; if you are thinking of watching it; do not waste time.Film seen on October 24; 2020.,Warning: Spoilers!I actually think this is the better film/movie. It relies less on toilet & vulgar humour to embarrass unsuspecting victims; and on more (in comparison!) subtle commentary on human behaviour and attitudes to deceive people into exposing their own views and reactions.The \\'moon blood dance\\' went wayyyy too far. Without being too frank; even a woman/girl from a poor country wouldn\\'t allow herself to deliberately leak through to the point of spoiling an expensive dress that would be extremely special for her. It just isn\\'t that messy unless you don\\'t use protection.\\nI know it\\'s for comedic effect; I just think it was more crass than funny and spoilt the tone of the film (even with all it\\'s anoos jokes).The rest was pretty clever though.The pro-life pastor being more interested in saving the \"baby\" than Borat seemingly admitting to sexual assault; child abuse & incest; the plastic surgeon nodding along to his description of the \\'jew nose\\' and happily telling Borat what he recommends doing to his daughter\\'s body whilst not directing any of the consultation to her until she asks if he\\'d \\'sex attack\\' her; the dress shop owner just laughing when he asks for a \\'no means yes\\' dress; his hosts openly admitting that they think that the Clintons drink children\\'s blood and that Democrats shouldn\\'t have rights; then later claiming that the Holocaust is a hoax (!); his song at the rally with the audience all happily singing back that various people should be injected with \\'Wuhan flu\\' (that 2s ago they sang was a hoax) or chopped up like Saudi\\'s; and the whole Rudi interview... all set up some very shocking; but funny & clever ways of exposing some of the extreme beliefs and behaviours towards certain people that permeate through society.Only the Instagram influencer is listed in the credits; and they mention that they explained in advance to the elderly holocaust survivors (that would have been rather cruel); so I can only assume that the others were being themselves on camera.The timing was just right for this sequel; with Covid & the US election in 10d. I\\'m not sure if they jumped on the opportunity to use Covid as a plot line; or it was just a coincidence that they were already filming; but it was a great way of showcasing some of the crazy things going on.Baron Cohen has a great talent for taking a silly character & a silly story and using them to create a clever narrative on the things he gets to observe.,I watched both movies in a row of two days; Yesterday I watched The first one;it was an AMAZING COMEDY MOVIE which talked about it\\'s targets too. But now The Second one wasn\\'t at least A Comedy ! I only liked to laugh at the first 20 mins and last 5 mins; The other parts was kind of Drama Or something like that. And also it wasn\\'t like that Document-Style the first movie had. The Second movie had Some targets and some messages which wanted to give to The audience but those messages is kinda \"Too Much Bold\" and hadn\\'t the cleverness of First Movie.\\nI liked it; But just For watch it only once. Of Course I won\\'t recommend anyone to watch it and I would suggest They Make Their Love With The 2006\\'s movie.\\nI was Hopeful for some lovely Things But I couldn\\'t find In Our Subsequent Moviefilm.High Five!,US politics is just crazy; so it\\'s the perfect anchor for satire. However simply bashing Trump and republicans and being politically one sided feels lazy and I feel like this movie could have been so much more if they\\'d explored the insanity on both sides of the US political divideInstead this feels kinda like \"here\\'s some laughs by the way vote Biden\",I came into this extremely excited; but it didn\\'t take long for me to realise that this film wasn\\'t going to live up to the original. I\\'d probably say there were 3 actually funny; non-scripted scenes that made me laugh and maybe 1/2 chuckle-worthy scenes. Whereas the original had me laughing and shocked the whole way through; this one had me sitting waiting for something funny to happen. I knew the originals greatness couldn\\'t be topped but this one really didn\\'t hit the mark. A decent comedy but don\\'t come expecting much if you\\'ve watched the original as it simply won\\'t compare.,I have been a SBC hardcore fan since 1997 and believe me when i say HARDCORE i mean it...........the first Borat was off the hook........but this one? eeeerm.............its an updated/same scripted version of the first one;exept the enemy is trump now;nearly same jokes........and the daughter? where do i start? talentless acting annoying accent and the whole vibe was that she never wanted to be in the movie..........i dunno i am split 50/50 i am glad to see another Borat...........but its outdated so to speak.........and btw why in gods name would they kill off Azamat??????????????? Ken Davitian stated in a recent interview he would star in any shape or form in Borat 2......but they killed him off? had it not been him SBC wont have won the golden globe,Timely sequel to the 2006 hit given that it has released on Amazon weeks before the US election. After serving a long prison sentence; Borat is sent on a mission to the US to give his daughter to Mike Pence thereby increasing Kazakhstan\\'s standing.Much the same as the original with plenty to enjoy; albeit the originality has passed; hence not the shocker the first one was. That said there are many wonderful swipes at Trump and his supporters incl the NRA; inherent racism; the belief in buzzwords and theatre rather than facts and the handling of COVID. Rudy Giuliani loses a lot of credibility here coming across as quite a creep (irrespective of who you vote for) it must be said - funny though.So ultimately quite a few laughs; some misfires but worth catching for the messages it sends. I think 2 is enough though.,I loved the first one. Did not feel the same. It was a propaganda flick which was unfortunate.Some funny scenes. Boards daughter stole the show.,A few decent laughs but the whole flick felt rushed and staged. I find it hard to believe anyone would be fooled by his characters now. It\\'s a shame because the first Borat movie might of been one of the greatest theater experiences ever. Never laughed so hard before; the whole audience was nuts. the actress who played his daughter was the real highlight in this.I Felt the Giuliani scene was interesting but not insanely funny. The period dance and the pro lifer scenes were the best. I general feel the exploitation of the kindness of the redneck dudes who took him in during the Covid lockdown weak.,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR RAW; TEAR DROPPING LAUGHTER FROM REAL REACTIONS TO BORATS MADNESS LIKE HE DELIVERED IN THE ORIGINAL; THEN YOU\\'LL BE AS DISAPPOINTED AS I WAS... IT\\'S NOT FUNNY WHEN THE TARGET IS IN ON IT... I\\'M SHOCKED THAT THIS COMIC GENIUS INSULTED THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS FANS BY ALLOWING THIS TO BE SHOWN TO AUDIENCES.,Meh. Obviously scripted and timed for a \"certain event\". Marginally watchable; and that\\'s if you\\'ve had a few; with only a couple of funny moments. Sacha should be ashamed of this partisan sellout; all the more so; since as an englishman; he has no business interfering with any of it.,They tried really hard to do what they did best in the first part. They did not succeed.,I\\'m gonna keep watching to see it but 30 mins in and I\\'m like ah....idk if it\\'s worth it! I loved the first one but that was a moment in time.,Its still hard to see who is in on the joke and who isnt. but overall i had a few laughs. but again it swings back and forth between cringe and humor. with the new political landscape it brings some new ideas; but like the previous film; it will get dated very quick.5/10: ye ok,Sadly this film\\'s directing style is more reminiscent of Cohen\\'s later movie; The Dictator; than it is his earlier works of the original Borat prequel or Bruno. More focus feels given to the fictional being of our Kazakh characters than it does actual reality. At times it comes off too in-your-face with the scriptedness or blatant editing; so the film never gives a chance for reality and its genuine characters to breath with same earnest reactions as the original film.While the film starts and finishes with a heavy-handed partisanship; it does work surprisingly well for the script and in today\\'s political scene. Unfortunately like all topical pieces; that also means this will not age well and be much forgotten.Overall; expect to get some cheap laughs; but don\\'t expect the same original masterpiece.,I\\'m not sure where the positive reviews come from but this just has to be the dumbest movie ever.,Sooo disappointing. Watched it all to ensure I saw the twist and political message behind the movie. But for a movie labelled \"comedy\" it\\'s not funny. It\\'s crude teenage boy comedy that adults would cringe at. Disgusting beyond belief. Hardly made a sound watching this movie. No rolling on floor laughing moments. Any slightly good parts felt like déjà vu. Did not need a part II of this movie. If you want to see a euro comedy watch \"Eurovision song competition\". If you want to lose 2 hours of your life and learn nothing watch this.,The movie doesn\\'t have the great in the moment scenes that the first one had. Giving these ordinary people lines to read to advance the plot fall on it\\'s face. Also frames entire scenes around trying to get \"gotcha\" moments from people that don\\'t go anywhere or have a funny punchline. The daughter character is well acted and funny; but the movie definitely has an agenda behind it. The final 10 minutes are straight propaganda. The jokes about how backwards Kazakhstan is are hilarious; but the jabs at Americans are lazy and tired.,It\\'s not as funny as the first one but it\\'s still damn funny. Borat\\'s daughter is actually a scene stealer in this. I liked it. Sacha baron cohen is a comedic genius and he\\'s just as funny in this one. I really liked the chemistry between these two. I\\'d watch Borat 3 in a second.,I was so excited for the sequel to a movie I call one of my favorites of all time. However this sequel just fell really short. Its highs are very high but its lows are sooooo low. It seems extremely slow at times. As well as failing to meet the magic the first one had with the real world interactions. The ending is fantastic and makes me want another one but in the way the last 25 minutes are shot. Not the every minute before it. Funny? Yes. Boring? Also kind of yes.,Over and over again...beating that horse. We get it; Cohen doesn\\'t like conservatives. Some parts are funny. Target everyone! Only redeemer is the people poked at fully accept Borat for who he is. They invite him into their homes treat him with respect. Same old story though. Gets aggravating.,She was great. But making a joke about shootings in a time when they\\'re actively happening is just f\\'d. Honestly I started off laughing at a few things then it just got dark and gross and the jewish jokes made me wish I never watched it. Upsetting.,Hard to believe it\\'s been 14yrs and the Borat character is still just as recognizable today. In fact; it\\'sso recognizable that I\\'d argue it\\'s impossible to believe all the bs stories about people suing because they felt tricked.\\nThat being said; I just couldn\\'t get the laughs from this film that I got from the original. I admit I found the actress playing the daughter super cute and both the main characters were talented; but the film relied so heavily on the same old jokes that I was barely able to muster a chuckle. For me; the primary laughs came from how ridiculous some of our political views sound when spoken out loud. I\\'d imagine too many people across the world they sound as ridiculous as they came across on screen.\\nMaybe I\\'m just older or too analytical not but I couldn\\'t find the pranks as plausible as I did during the original.\\nWith nothing else to do; it\\'s a movie that passes the time but that\\'s mostly all it is.\\nI\\'d imagine anyone who liked Borat is going to watch this and everyone else will pass; I can\\'t imagine anyone being on the fence about this one...,Idk when u can ever say the second movie was better the the first one but this was the case sad to say I liked it but I didn\\'t think they took the best approach on politics like they liked to play out in the movie as they made some scenes real life events and some choreographed how is the audience supposed to know Wuts real and not real other then thinking the whole movie is real staged hidden cam events even though it\\'s not how are the audience supposed to know the difference this movie is misleading,I am normally a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; but he should be ashamed of himself for coming out with this dross. I am sure he will pretend it was a satire of patriarchy; but really it was just an excuse to demean women for cheap laughs.,Menstruation is not a joke. Please someone tell this to creator.\\nI regret to see this movie.,However; it was mildly entertaining. Too much reliance on subtitles; imo. Maria Bakalova (as Tutar) did an amazing job. I would recommend this to watch; but it isn\\'t going to win any awards.,Movie is hilarious except for 1 scene that is truly disgusting. Made me want to vomit. I had to close my eyes until it was over. Why do movie makers think they constantly have to push to film what is ugly or disgusting? Don\\'t confuse innovation with disgusting. There is nothing noteworthy about it.,Whilst simplistic in its message the very charm is how deliberate it is ....and well executed. Plus funny. Cringe worthy at times of course. Tutar stands out. Cohen is an extraordinary talent.,Very funny and many scenes to talk about with your friends. Do not believe the one-stars from those who were offended politically. If easily offended; you will be.,Some laughs but struggled to find the meaning of it all. The last film was more of a documentary.,Full of farcical prank jokes! And parodies of political incorrect jokes. After five years of Trump; this is not funny anymore. Political humor is just not my cup of tea.,I had some laughs; less than with original Borat; Bruno or Dictator. The problem was that he was going after predictable politically correct targets; not taking any risks like other comedians these days do.For example during the movie I could imagine just as funny situations and chants he could create if he was going after targets on the other end of the political spectrum.,Maria stifles laughs throughout; which is not good for an undercover actor. There\\'s a lot of deceptive cuts; etc. Borat doesn\\'t really offer anything fresh apart from a little woke moralizing on the side. There are some cute moments - the old jewish lady; and the qanon flatmates; but like the first film I didn\\'t find this particularly funny. I think I might actually prefer ali-g; something that was definitely coming from a more light hearted place than this film.,Comparing any sequel to an A+ original is going to be difficult. Having said that; I loved it. I thought he did a great job; especially with the fact that halfway through production; the virus hit and must have changed his original plan for the movie. When I think about it; the only thing I would have liked more is if there were less parts of him playing Borat being disguised as somebody else. Because; I get he\\'s an international celebrity; though the first film was 15 years ago; I think he could have gotten away with being Borat in public more. But it was hilarious with many wild moments. And his daughter; Titar; was outstanding; I would love a spin-off show or film just with her character. There is supposed to be much more great footage that wasn\\'t in the film; so I hope for an extended cut; or a release with deleted and extended scenes.,Doesn\\'t have the same charm as the first one. Focuses too heavily on current events and politics. It\\'s essentially a long SNL skit.,I really liked the first movie and I understand what Sacha Cohen is trying to do here. He had to top his first movie by making this one even more cruder and offensive than the first; and at that he succeeded. In the Borat style; the film is clever and some of his anecdotes are brilliant and hilarious (leading the viewer to think he is about to call Trump a bad President; for instance; only to then say Obama was the dictator and Trump was a Strongman Savior)With that said; there is also a very dark side of this film which essentially is that Sacha Cohen is making light and poking fun at human trafficking. The entire plot revolved around giving his daughter as a bride to a rich powerful man; and at several points Borat says he is \"selling her to her new owner\". She is made to live in a cage and at several points Borat says he has raped her simply because he wanted to and had gotten her pregnant as a result.Honestly; at least in my opinion; the film does go a little bit too far especially since the real Kazakhstan; as with many of the former Soviet republics; does have a very serious problem with human trafficking. I\\'m sure some people will say its only a movie; and they would be right; but what if there were scenes of the daughter getting beaten or raped by multiple men and forced into prostitution. That is the reality that this movie is essentially making fun of and it wouldn\\'t be so funny then.,Republicans think denis miller; john voight and every other conservative a**hole in hollywood are gods with their bs and hyperbolics lies; but when an actor they disagree with ideologically makes them look stupid they cry and say their opinion doesn\\'t matter... Almost like you\\'re all hypocrites? Facts don\\'t matter as long as I agree with the actor; and you wonder why you idiots elect ppl like trump? Good luck murica,This one didn\\'t have the same high brow; clever comedy as many of his other shows. Too partisan and not willing to go after everyone,A few laugh out loud moments; compared to the first nowhere near as good.\\nA lot of gags fall flat and felt forced.,Okay; taking away every political thing about this movie out of it; it just wasn\\'t as funny as the first with almost everything feeling staged. There was to much time spent between Borat and his daughter which isn\\'t what borat should be about it\\'s about him being funny and making people uncomfortable. I get it people recognized him and that can be difficult and with saying that then I\\'m sorry don\\'t make another movie then. This looked like a crash grab and or a political hit job to just say what everyone already hears in movies now which is trump sucks; vote Democrat. Okay we get it now can we get back to making movies funny and good again. I\\'m not political and sometimes I just don\\'t want to hear it all the time when I just wanna sit back and watch a movie. I\\'m saying that there where some funny moments like when he\\'s stuck inside with those two men other then that everything felt like the people where told there was a camera and didn\\'t make it authentic. It was just weird to see a sequel of a movie that was such a cultural phenomenon and then completely make it about politics I mean everything was and then also making it very staged. So; in conclusion it was okay some funny parts but overall if I was to tell you that another borat movie came out you would not expect this kinda movie at all. Also I\\'m kinda curious after this election how movies will be made if Biden wins because for the past five years we\\'ve heard and have seen the same jokes rehashed over and over so if he\\'s not there anymore what will movies look like? Just a thought.,I won\\'t go super fancy critic here as I\\'m not an English speaker.The first movie was impressive; couldn\\'t believe what I was watching. This time that shock won\\'t happen and the movie just feels as easy 2020 dem propaganda. While Borat will last classic and atemporal; this will be remembered as a short term polytical campaign.Ps: still 6 as the jokes still kinda politically incorrect at least.,First 15-20 minutes of the movie were promising; really good. Later; bad taste entered the scene..\\n-Toilet humor(unnecessary)\\nTo many scripted scenes and actors who made a deal with crew(cringes)Present; political topics; which will made this film unwatchable after some time.,OK but now the global tech giants want Biden in do no balance to who he humiliates. As a UK fan and no interest in us politics disappointing that there no objectivity. Still funny but we\\'ve seen it all before.,Anyone beyond the age of 3 who found anything remotely funny in this travesty or in the previous Borat movie is more intellectually shortchanged than the Trump Chumps. Hollywood has reached a new low. Yes; I loved the way it ridicules the fundamentalcase Klueless Kristian Kluxxers; & that is why it got a 2 rather than a 1 rating.,As a Sasha baron Cohen fan. I\\'m was disappointed. He always pushes the boundaries; but this was \"old hat\".\\nFrom Ali g to the spy. The guy is genius. This film though was tripe. Same jokes; just rehashed. You can\\'t play characters like Borat; ali g or bruno. More than once; the public won\\'t fall for it. Such ashame; because the first borat film was great. Hence 4/10 come on Sasha you can do better.,Largely compete for best movie for the oscars. A great great film about us; about our era.,It is amazing the lengths Sacha Baron Cohen and co star Maria Bakalova go to for the sake of comedy. They are relentless and I was in cracking up the whole time. The film also has heart and good intentions. Loved it.,Borat completely destroyed manusmriti and trump in one movie. All sanghis and republicans should watch - movie is for you. High five Borat,Obviously there was also a lot of bias before at the first film but everything was satirical and not really serious.... joking about our misunderstaing of diffrent coltures povery hate and so on\\nbut this feels like pure propoganda... extreme mislead and....\\nfunny still beacuse of how silly and idiotic it is...,It was ok. Pushed the edge as always just seemed forced. I think with all the politics we are already getting all day every day it probably would\\'ve been better to release next year after all this stuff is over.... hopefully,Cannot understand why the Kazakhstanian daughter speaks Bulgarian all the time (OK that the actress is Bulgarian - Maria Bakalova)..? I believe for some Bulgarians and Kazakhstanians who will watch it would be annoying; as it is for me; honestly.,Borat is back and after upsetting practically everyone following the events of the 2006 original film he attempts to make amends by offering a prize to a senior US political figure. Naturally; things don\\'t run smoothly and both Borat and his unwilling subject form an unlikely bond as the narrative progresses....I absolutely loved the original Borat and when I learned recently that a sequel was streaming on Amazon Prime I leapt at the chance and decided to watch it this evening. Whilst on the whole I enjoyed this sequel it\\'s definitely missing something when compared to the original...It starts out well and there are several moments in the first 20 minutes or so that are very reminiscent of the original Borat film; there\\'s the naivety and general sense of innocence with the character of Borat that we witnessed in the original film which were a big factor in making the original film work. However; in the sequel these aspects seem to be lost somewhere from 30 minutes onwards...Ok so the film is still fun and remains this way throughout; but the actual subtext to the story is extremely heavy-handed and somewhat unnecessary; somebody within the cast or production team is clearly heavily right-wing/republican and I did find that the serious political stance did take away from the film. This is offset at times by Borat and the republicans downplaying the virus (which does afford the film with some of its funnier moments); but what made the original film work so well is that you genuinely felt that you were watching an idiot go to America; make a fool of himself but with subtle winks to the camera.In this sequel the plot gets in the way far too much and the heavy-handed approach employed arguably takes away more than it adds (it\\'s shamelessly right-wing and pro-Trump which for me regardless of your political allegiance) makes the film too self-aware and makes it less funny. Thankfully the film does get back on track from time to time (the idea that Borat has inadvertently injected himself with the virus and spread it around the world is where the film is strong and had the film focussed on this I think it would have been better - essentially seeing an idiot inadvertently creating a global pandemic)Still Sacha Baron Cohen is as brilliant as he always is and newcomer Maria Bakalova is also excellent (and her makeover transformation is incredible). Whilst the final scenes in the film were hilarious I found the heavy-handed politics a little too much at times. It almost felt like I was watching a lengthy pro-Republican/Anti-democratic broadcast (and the sheer number of Trump\\'s cabinet that appeared in the film merely re-inforces this point making me think he either had a hand in bankrolling the film or somebody in the production crew was a big Republican).All that being said; this sequel to Borat made me laugh (a lot) and the ridiculous hyperbole surrounding the virus also resonated with me (I agree that it\\'s all overhyped). This sequel is still good; but second time around things feel a little too serious and self-aware which tarnish the overall quality of this sequel.,The original Borat was almost certainly the funniest thing Sacha Baron Cohen did. This film retreads similar ground in way that is quite difficult to distinguish from the original but it just doesn\\'t have the same vibe.Cohen is no different as Borat but the appendage of a clear political agenda to this film simply changes the character of the movie. Right wing Americans; Trump supporters; po-faced Christians etc just seem like not so much easy targets but incredibly predictable ones. The whole movie; framed around attempts to give Borat\\'s daughter away as some kind of sex gift; first to Pence and then Giuliani makes this film a piece of not remotely subtle political propaganda. In fact I almost hesitate to use the term because the kind of propaganda we encounter these days tries to disguise it\\'s purpose. Borat 2 at least has the decency not to do that. Sacha Baron clearly has very real political / ethical concerns about the illiberal nature of the Trump led Republican party & this film is simply about trying to damage the enemy.I can respect that I guess; but it makes it hard to take it as comedy in any kind of pure sense; which is something which really alters the movie; for however much Sacha Baron Cohen may remain the same very funny guy; he has lost his capacity to portray Borat as genuinely innocent.We experience this as a greater distance from the character; & the lack of something which was so important in the original film - the sense that at any moment Borat might do something truly shocking but innocent; so outrageous that it is cringeworthy. The problem here is though the shocking language & scatology come thick & fast they don\\'t have the same power to make us titter.The second main reason this is so is one the film addresses fairly early on: we know & Borat knows that most people already know all about him; that he\\'s famous & the possibility of milking comedy out of people caught completely off their guard has largely vanished. What this means in practice is that while we suspect that a lot of the film is basically scripted & performed by paid actors pretending to not know what is going on; where we suspect Borat might actually have caught someone unawares; we are still not sure it is a \\'real\\' encounter. It really isn\\'t Cohen\\'s fault that that is the case. He & the film-makers do their best to work around this but ultimately it is a huge weight round the film; even where the script is sound & the jokes are fairly objectively funny.In fact the only clearly unscripted events in the film are the gate-crashing of a Republican party convention where Pence is the guest speaker - the look on Pence\\'s face is priceless - a mixture of sadness & anger - & the interview with Rudy Giuliani. Rudy clearly does get suckered a little bit by Tutar; Borat\\'s much abused daughter; become journalist. It doesn\\'t look like anything would have happened but Giuliani is clearly charmed & flattered by the over-awed attention of the pretty young blonde woman with a confidence problem; who needs defending from her overbearing camerman (father). In fact it\\'s rather disconcerting how successfully they play Giuiliani in this way.There are some other funny bits. The beginning is quite funny. The absurdity doubling down on the calumies against Khazakstan as a nation are quite funny as is the idea that Khazakstanis are offended by holocaust-deniers because they are proud of their role in causing the holocaust (I\\'m fairly sure this is completely unfair to Khazakstan but who knows).But the jokes by and large are few & far between & mostly what we get - far more than in the original - is a story about Borat\\'s mission (to gift his daughter to Pence/Giuiliani) & the evolution of his relationship to his daughter.It\\'s here that something quite odd happens. While Borat seems slightly lame & stale; the daughter Tutar is actually really good. She has a genuine feel for the piss-take aspect of the Borat format; & seems a complete natural in the role; playing the almost savage caged downtrodden female (Borat\\'s Khazakstan seems to have doubled down on \"evil patriarchy\" since the last movie) with relish & really getting into the - probably best scene in the movie - the joint dance at the debutante scene. I said earlier that we were never quite sure whether the people getting sent up or outraged were real or actors - well I\\'m fairly sure the society figures & debutantes were real - the look of shock & disgust was almost certainly geniune & the same probably is true for the christian ladies who Tutar speaks out to later on.This aside the film dragged alot; & I never cared much about what happened. Sacha Baron Cohen is enormously talented; but he\\'s not quite as sympathetic as he used to be. Overall I preferred his Grimsby with Mark Strong over this by far.,In two weeks; half of the movie\\'s content becomes irrelevant. That said; it had its heartfelt moments in the synagogue and with the Patriot guys taking him in. The actress playing his daughter is a force to be reckoned with; under SBC\\'s wing she can really go far in the world of cinematic

Subsequent Moviefilm: Delivery of Prodigious Bribe to American Regime for Make Benefit Once Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan is very naiiice!America Mayor Rudolph Giuliani say he not like film.America Mayor Rudolph Giuliani say he very much LIE\\ndown to fix pants like in nation of Kazakhstan where we not stand up to tuck the shirt. Much success.You watch.Chin qui,What\\'s even funnier than the movie itself; is seeing people cry about it. I mean; damn; Cohen just exposes the stuff; he doesn\\'t make them say or do what they say and do. If you\\'re mad at anyone; be mad at the buffoons caught on tape. Or on second thought; keep being mad here; cause its hella hilarious.Great movie. Had richer; deeper laughs than the first; though not as many. Plus; it\\'s on Amazon; so you can basically watch it for what you already pay or get yourself a free trial.Great s#!^!,For those saying Giuliani was just tucking in his shirt; why lay down on a bed to do so instead of STANDING UP? And that; folks; is part of the genius of this film: that is shows you; live on video what\\'s going on; and lets those who want to continue to lie to themselves; to continue to do so; while being laughed at by others. Don\\'t miss it.,Nothing more needs to be said than: LOOK at the 1 ratings and the vehemence (and bad English) with which they try to dissuade you from watching Borat 2! You KNOW it has to be good.WATCH it.,Borat is back; with this subsequent moviefilm.\\nThis will be compared to the original to no end; but with borat being a cultural icon in America; this one was bound to be very different.I loved this film; it made me topple with laughter multiple times. The accomplishment of making this within a pandemic is also a massive achievement.\\nDo I think this is better then the first one? No.\\nDo I think this is a hilarious movie? Absolutely.This one seems a lot more planned narratively and has a lot more scripted scenes; not bad things at all.\\nThe girl playing borat\\'s daughter was also great.Very nice!,The Giuliani portion alone; makes this a must-watch. Can this administration get any CREEPIER? Why yes; it can!Speaking of .... the Fertility Dance; alone; is yet another reason to watch. It is not for the feint of heart; but it is like nothing (hopefully); you\\'ve ever seen before; or (hopefully); that you will ever see again.The rest is just icing ... and cake ... and a cherry. Maria Bakalova is ridiculously ADORABLE. Jeanise Jones is all heart.STOP CRYING; you insipid detractors! Relax just a little and LAUGH!,If you love Borat; you will understand that the bad reviews are the best reviews. Sacha Baron Cohen threw a bomb in our actual society... And I LOVED IT.\\nEvery sensitive issue that exists today; Cohen broke it with nothing more than the truth that is so much being concealed.\\nEven if the scenes are fake; he talked about subjects that no one really wanted to talk; and that\\'s why this movie is going to get controversial and some people will obviously hate it. But that was its objective and it means Sacha Baron Cohen did an amazing job.\\nI would write a longer review about this incredible movie; but it\\'s about those who see it that will know this movie is indisputably amazing.,Not as good as the first one (it doesn\\'t even come close); but still very funny at times. The actress who plays the daughter could be the next big thing; she is fantastic in her role.,I can\\'t deny I laughed pretty hard about 2 times and chuckled like 3 times; but most of the movie was a flatliner for me. I am a big fan of the first movie and I think where this one falls apart for me is that it focuses too much on current events (that the movie will probably be irrelevant in a few years); focuses way too much on politics and on the plot with Borat\\'s daughter. Many people are praising her performance here. I think she\\'s fine; but I don\\'t think the script is anything special here and it doesn\\'t help the actors. The scenes I enjoyed the most are those with Borat doing his thing by himself; but a lot of it felt to me like attempting to recreate the mood of the original.,IMPORTANT before you begin the MovieFilm go to the subtitles and:\\n1) Turn on\\n2) switch to EnglishI realize this sounds obvious; but the default is OFF and the language of Kazakhstan (apparently). I wasted the first 20 minutes missing all the Textual humour because I couldn\\'t understand either the dialogue or text. After a second attempt; I was able to switch the subtitles to English which make the MovieFilm Very Nice.You really need English subtitles. Really. At first; I just thought the foreign subtitles were part of the joke. NOT!,I think this movie is a very solid demonstration of freedom of speech in USA and I envy it a lot.\\nI live in Turkey and I can\\'t imagine such a political satire movie of TR government being shown in our theaters or TVs without getting banned or somehow punished.\\nAmerican citizens are free to mock their government; president; his wife and their supporters in movies and mainstream media; and they are not labeled as \\'traitors\\' or get arrested for interrogation.,It\\'s Borat. Crude; offensive; and fun. It will probably get a bunch of 1\\'s from the poli-cry-babies who claim they aren\\'t judging it based on the fact that it goes against their values; but they are. It\\'s a stupid comedy and it was entertaining. If you don\\'t like stupid comedies then this just isn\\'t for you.,1st borat movie was brilliant because no one knew about the character at the time; this time it was horribly scripted and politically one sided. No where near as funny as the first one,All throughout the movie I couldn\\'t help but notice that most of the pranks are fake and unreal. I mean is there a single person in America that doesn\\'t recognize sacha baron cohen; even with tons of beard and hair and all that makeup. Screw republicans and democrats; screw trump and biden; screw politics; borat used to be a genuine comedy full of incredible extreme pranks ; but now it looks like a political garbage desperately trying to deliver a propaganda.,I really was excited for this movie but it didn\\'t deliver at all. It felt extremely rushed and the comedy wasn\\'t there. I laughed once during the entire movie. It\\'s obvious they had a deadline and pushed this out to meet it. This was a huge bummer. I wanted Borat not this.,Don\\'t see this if you don\\'t want to be entertained or experience cringe worthy moments but especially don\\'t see this if you don\\'t want to see a true breakout star in the hysterical and lovely; Maria Bakalova who reminds me of a young Tracy Ullman. She is amazing.,Borat 2 is just as funny as the first one. I missed half the movie because I was laughing so hard so I had to watch it again! 99% of these negative reviews are from Trumpers who hate anything that goes against their leader! They hate Hollywood; the left; or anyone else that tells the truth about their POS leader! If you want to laugh as hard as you have in a long time then go watch this movie!,If people think this is left-wing propaganda and the first Borat film didn\\'t poke fun at the right; clearly is not very observant! Borat was never for you; so stop with the faux outrage!This was hilarious. Not as good as the first but still hilarious. The scene in the clinic was all kinds of hysterical and cringy combined. The actress who played his daughter stole the show this timeVery nice...high five!!!!,The movie is fun; offensive; occasionally not for weak stomachs and obviously legendary already for the Giuliani bit.\\nBut Maria Bakalova as Borats daughter really kills it and I truly hope this opens the doors for her for a full fledged Hollywood career. I\\'ll keep my fingers crossed.,Brilliant and full of laughs within the first 10 minutes that continue. This has Borat in the title but Tutar Sagdiyev aka the daughter of Borat aka real name Maria Bakalova is a new star.,Borat 2 is an absolutely hilarious movie. The first one was so funny I thought there would be a let down but I was dead wrong because this was almost just as good. Sasha Baron Cohan is a genius!,Borat A subsequent movie film\\n2020\\n15\\nDirector: Jason Woliner\\nStarring: Sacha Baron Cohen; Maria Bakalova etcOverall rating 91/100Borat the subsequent moviefilm sees the return of Borat (Sacha Baron Cohen) who must return to America in order to sell his daughter to powerful American politicians but he grows a connection with her. Well what can I say Borat 2 was bonkers and insane; but mostly brilliant; clever and had a lot more heart than the first film; so let\\'s get started.First of all the movie was very funny; had great comedic performances and chemistry as well as a fun set up. This movie was absolutely hilarious; even more outrageously funny than the first film; there was so many funny comedy skits; highlighting and cleverly taking the mick out of a lot of republicans and how they have handled many things; it\\'s humour was even more clever; and due to everything that\\'s going on right now gave even more comedic opportunities and satire for Borat to be involved with. The comedic performance from Sacha Baron Cohen was also as expected fantastic; he bought the character of Borat back to life perfectly with fantastic dialogue and his form of comedy and his comedic timing was excellent here; but also Maria Bakalova was fantastic here as well; she held her own with Sacha and in some places was even more funny than him; they both had excellent chemistry with each other and watching there relationship develop was great. The set up for the movie was also very fun; having the view of Kazakhstan being the complete opposite and Borat being forced out of the country set up the main plot point and new characters well; and was a creative way to develop the story.My only negative for the movie would be that they went slightly too far with some of the comedy. I did feel like the movie went slightly over the line with certain skits and costumes that felt more offensive than funny for me in places; the movie usually does a great job at being controversial but still able to get away with it; but I definitely think they went slightly too far in a couple of places.My final few positives would be the themes; links to real people; costumes and heartwarming moments. The movie had really great themes of really showing you how extreme and horrible a lot of Trump supporters opinions are and was a shocking but needed insight into the political divide in America; the links to real life people like Melania Trump or the random name drops and cameos for comedic effect were excellent and cleverly executed. The costume designs for Borat were also excellent and funny; due to the success of the first film Sacha was being recognised more by the public; so hats off to the costume team for providing very convincing and often hilarious costumes for Borat to wear. Finally the movie had a lot more heartwarming moments than the first film; the themes of women being capable of anything and that everyone is human and not so different was handled really well; with some genuinely kind and caring people involved within the film that was very sweet to watch.Overall Borat 2 a subsequent movie film; despite going slightly too far in places; is just as clever; outrageous and hilarious as the first film with a great new member of the cast and more heart than the first film.,Amazing; Sacha remains a genius.Fantastic work.As with all his work it\\'s amazing. He always uncovers such gross and frightening attitudes and opinions.,One or two raunchy laughs. Nothing special. Cannot even be compared to first film. The movie is about 90 minutes long; and 75 of it is somewhat boring.,I\\'be been a fan of SBC since he was Ali G on UK TV. Back then his comedy was a breath of fresh air. The first Borat film was hilarious as was Grimsby. But this effort fell flat and the dull story couldn\\'t be revived by the extreme vulgarity in the story. I don\\'t think I laughed more than a couple of times. Final verdict: terrible.,Borat and his \\'daughter\\' are fantastic!\\nTears in my eyes.\\nWe need more of this in these times!,Even it has loads of more or less light triggers I laughed way too often and I don\\'t regret it at all! Loved the first movie and the whole idea behind a soft scripted movie with a lot of improvisations and also dancer for Sacha Baron Cohen and the crew! Amazing what he\\'s doing just for make the audience laugh and tell his point of few.\\nWaiting for the next one ;),I thought it was way funnier than the first. Mr. Cohen is just so awesome and hilarious. The movie was funny all throughout. Would recommend.,The main appeal of part one was being able to observe the culture clash during the confrontations with real people out there in the wild. This one replaced all of that with cringe-worthy; Reality TV level fake BS. And the grand finale/scandal is clever editing and shameful practices at best; entrapment and defamation at worst. Most of the jokes and social commentary contained feel like someone rushed to harvest the lowest hanging fruit and turned them into an easily digested; yet nutritionally completely void sludge for the lowest common denominator audience. Strange to see from such a seemingly intelligent guy.,What a violent on American culture; the debutantes ball and their dance was great.Some Americans will not appreciate it; but the rest of us will laugh.,Subsequent Moviefilm follows the same basic premise as the first movie; Sacha Baron Cohen dresses up as an outlandish character and travels across America pranking real American citizens; and revealing the true nature of normal people; from the good to the bad. This time however; instead of chasing after Pamela Anderson; Borat has his daughter with him; and hopes to marry her off to one of Trump\\'s political allies in order to earn a better reputation for glorious nation of Kazakhstan. This results in a much more interesting and engaging story; and gives us another character to get to know and really root for. Azamat; the producer in the first movie; was never given much attention as a character. He was just someone for Borat to feed off of. But Tutar is not treated the same way; and even has her own character arc and her own chances to prank people. Not to mention the twists and turns brought on by current events that were moulded into the story so effortlessly it\\'s hard to believe they started filming this last year before everything hit the fan. Not only is the pandemic slotted in so seamlessly; but it manages to elevate the movie - from a narrative standpoint - far above anything else Baron Cohen has done.Of course Borat is all about the pranks; and while the tighter narrative of the movie does make the whole affair feel a lot more scripted; it\\'s no less funnier for it (in fact it might debatably be funnier; but we\\'ll get there in a minute). Definite highlights include Tutar\\'s time with the Jeanise; the babysitter; who thought she was participating in a real documentary about teenage brides. What she puts up with from newcomer Maria Bakalova is astounding; and she comes across as the most effortlessly caring and wholesome person; doing what she can to change Tutar\\'s worldview. She\\'s also low-key hilarious by herself; such as her reaction to Tutar calling the Earth flat; or the way she points out that breast implants are not going to change much in Tutar\\'s life. Another entirely wholesome highlight is Borat\\'s 5-day stay with a couple of redneck guys who; while clearly misinformed themselves; do all they can to educate Borat. These are guys who think Coronavirus is fake; and avoid liberal people as much as they can; and yet they take a complete stranger into their home when he had nowhere to stay (at least to their knowledge); and offer assistance however they can. Baron Cohen dressed as Trump bursting in on a speech by Mike Pence; the constant back-and-forth with a poor postman and his fax machine; and the pair going to a pro-life health centre to remove a candy baby from Tutar are hilarious as well; while the Women\\'s Club and Debutante scenes are prime cuts of cringe and embarrassment.Between all of that and the more traditional comedy moments between Borat and Tutar; I would argue Subsequent Movefilm is a far funnier movie than the first Borat. The first had its moments for sure; but Subsequent Moviefilm is almost relentless with its jokes. It not only aims higher; but hits higher as well. The more obviously scripted nature of the film is bound to turn off some die-hard fans; but for me it meant the jokes were really worked on and refined in order to be as funny as they could possibly be. The best example of this is the Disney-parody of Melania Trump; and her first meeting with Trump; all in Disney-style cartoon. And then was the song Borat performs really written by the rednecks? I doubt it; it has Baron Cohen all over it. But that didn\\'t make his performance of it at the anti-mask rally any less hilarious to watch.\\nBut of course being a Borat movie; there\\'s more here than just the comedy. Beneath the jokes and pranks is more of a look at the highs and lows of American society. I\\'ve already mentioned how wholesome both the black babysitter and the rednecks were despite their political viewpoints; but it swings the other way as well. The pastor at the women\\'s health centre barely bats an eye at the implication that Borat impregnated his daughter; and in light of those revelations; still refuses Tutar\\'s right to an abortion. Not to mention the numerous occasions of unashamed creeps like the plastic surgeon who admits he would take advantage of Tutar was Borat not present; or Guiliani himself who did not come off in a particularly great light even before the moment of controversy. Then there\\'s the frightening situations of mob mentality Borat encounters; such as his prank on Mike Pence being met with the crowd chanting \"four more years\"; or his racist; misogynistic; and anti-Semitic song being welcomed and cheered on by a crowd of anti-maskers. Baron Cohen said himself that he was forced to wear a bulletproof vest on a couple of occasions; something he was never required to do for the first film.Some of this movie will not age well; most notably anything relating to coronavirus (which ended up being nearly half the movie); while other moments (again coronavirus related) have aged like a fine wine already. Baron Cohen appears so much more at home in the character of Borat than he ever was in the first movie; resulting in his pranks being so much more effective; as well his general acting making the whole affair a lot more convincing. Unfortunately for him; he discovered Maria Bakalova who is astonishing and gives it her all. There was not a single moment she wasted; and she committed one hundred percent to every gag and every prank; not only keeping up with Baron Cohen; but sometimes completely blowing him out of the water. Some people will hate the increased sense of script; while I feel the movie benefited greatly from it; and it\\'s still chock full of candid improv moments to keep it as Borat as always. I enjoyed this a lot more than the first movie; like it\\'s not even close. I could definitely see myself watching this again in the near future. I give it a very high 8/10 (so high I genuinely debated giving it a 9).,It\\'s just bad; 98% it\\'s all scripted and staged and the daughter\\'s scenes are not funny.\\nThe old Borat would have epic non staged scenes and he would make fun of anyone; doesn\\'t matter their political side; race or gender. In 2020 we would expect Borat to crash rallies; parades and cupcakes student councils. But nothing... Just staged unfunny stuff and same jokes all over again. Very disappointed. Just watch the old movies. This one is super boring.Basically he just played it safe. He\\'s afraid to be canceled so he just went after people that don\\'t go crazy on Twitter. Old Borat (and Bruno or Ali G) would never be afraid of being canceled.,Don\\'t get me wrong. I laughed myself silly quite a few times. But the tone of this sequel seemed off; and it took a while to realize the difference.In the original; Borat played such a complex; naive character; a true fish out of water. If you had encountered such a person in real life; you\\'d wholeheartedly want to help him. And that\\'s where the original\\'s hijinks started.Subtle character differences in this one; though. The seemingly sweet veneer was gone at times. Rather than having some more or less harmless fun with the unknowing participants; he struck a harsher mocking tone. Several scenes are rather cringeworthy. Some kind; decent people bent over backwards to help a guy in a bad spot; and caught nothing but crap for their efforts. I\\'d call that a big misfire; and it severely detracted from any desired comedic tone.,This movie is extremely stupid and not funny at all; the first one was better. Don\\'t waste your time,The original film was superb but this sequel is predictable; poorly written and just plain boring. Let me just put out there now that I\\'m no fan of Trump and my opinion is by no means biased. However the film tries too hard to smear conservatives and it just ends up looking desperate and unfunny.\\nFurthermore the sense of deja vu is overwhelming as SBC recycled far too much from the original and it just does not work in 2020. Introducing a significantly new character is often a sign of desperation and the introduction of Borat\\'s daughter Tutar is no exception. She\\'s like Scrappy doo in Scooby doo or the sand snakes in Game of thrones. Tutar is another awful character but I understand why she was necessary as Borat is too well known in 2020 to trick people into an interview. It begs the question was this film necessary? I would say definitely not. For me it has soured the Borat character and taken some shine from the original film. SBC is a genius but I can only imagine that he was forced into making this film for political reasons.,I\\'m European and as anti Trump as you can be; but it\\'s just not very good; it\\'s some silly acting with about 3 poor; unimportant pranks around potty humor. It\\'s not even as extreme as most of the news that comes out of the US; or Q Anon and other clowns on Facebook. If you want awkward; funny pranks that make you laugh; Impractical Jokers is funny; but this? This is just people watching someone be ridiculous; they don\\'t even interact this time round...,Tired and repetitive.\\nThe Borat character was mildly amusing in the first film. For about half an hour. There was nothing there that was even remotely funny and this second film reinforces that.\\nI am so reminded of the meerkats in the TV ads (they are unfunny and irritating also).\\nThis bloke has turned a ten minute sketch into a very unfunny career. A bit like Steve Coogan.,Not funny; not smart; a lampooning designed to appeal to the halfwitted.\\nYou will get more humour and intellect in the Great British Bake off.,This was unwatchable. I made it 37 minutes and realised it was utter garbage. Not funny at all. Not even tongue in cheek funny. Not even kindly amusing. Just tired. Very tired.,Just for the record; I\\'m not from the US. I expected the movie to be Anti Trump but this is a waste of time and not funny by a mile. Sasha lost it big time. Boring jokes; not even worth a chuckle,Loved Borat! This is weak in laughs; inauthentic character; boring! Wanted stop watching yet still hoped SOMETHING would redeem it. Nothing did.,Disappointed.after the first movie. Fake and disgusting from beginning to the end. I know you\\'re going to watch it regardless; at least know that you\\'ll be watching a third class movie.,It\\'s not funny; humour for people intellectually impaired; Coen is out of his tricks; terrible; offensive and simply stupid...better have a nap then watch Coehn turd... utterly disgusting; low level humor; avoid...how this get 7 starts?? go figure,This is bad. I used to like Sacha Baron Cohen; but; not anymore. All he ever does is dress up like some weird character and pretend to be dumb in the hope of tricking people into saying embarrassing things. What I really hate is that a lot of the people he tricks are just being nice and even trying to help him; but; he tries to frame it in such a way that they look like bad people. It is all just so his clique of liberal cosmopolitan elites can look down on Muslims and Christians. I will admit that Cohen is smart and capable of being funny; but; he is not as smart or funny as he thinks he is. I watched this with my family (who loved the first movie) and they did not laugh once during this film. It is all basically the same formula and really forced. I imagine this will get quite good reviews because he attacks Trump and most critics will love that; but; this is not a good movie. There really isn\\'t anything that was not already covered in the first movie. They did not need to make a sequel; it is really bad and a complete waste of time and money. Borat has officially jumped the shark.,Pretty much same old clichés. No longer funny. He\\'s a clever guy and has done some very good stuff but this is schoolboy humour. Very disappointing,I never saw the original movie. It just didn\\'t appeal to me. I ended up wanting to watch another comedy tonight so I threw this one on. I\\'ve never laughed so much. This movie was HILARIOUS to me! Call me immature; today; on my 39th birthday; but I found this humor wonderfully crude; politically incorrect; and a breathe of fresh air. I also loved the \"real world scenes\". Did he actually get these people to believe he was who he said he was??? That was amazing. I need an explanation. To Google I go lol.,Very nice 👍👍👍 would recommend. 10/10. Might make you fall asleep; but sleep is always nice so I don\\'t see that as a bad thing.,The first film was genuinely funny. This round; released on the eve of the last debate and a week before the election; is entirely motivated as a political party smear. Regardless of one\\'s particular politics i enjoy movies to get away from politics. At least a warning would be appreciated.,Tasteless ronthevpoint of not being the least bit funny.,Unfortunately; I can\\'t rate it less than one star. It\\'s not funny; stupid and disgusting. First Borat movie was bad; but this one hit the bottom.,Not funny like the first one. It must be because it had a purely political motive rather than a comedic motive.,First Borat movie is so much better and actually funny. This is just cringey mess with unfunny;forced daughter who just shouting nosenses whole time and thinks its funny. Which made whole movie unwatchable for me. Rather Watch Borat in Britain or Ali G,I mean if you didn\\'t like the comedy and rudeness of borat you will definitely not appreciate the comedy of this film either as it is 100 times ruder than the original beside from that it was a perfect sequel to a very creative and funny film the acting was brilliant and borat managed to yet again achieve his goal of once again showing people\\'s real ideas,We cant expect it to be as crude and funny as before sadly thanks to cancel culture but borat still pushes boundries . Entertaining for sure.,Discriminatory; while mocking discrimination. Sadly hypocritical film-making. A shame.,Nothing quite like trying to escape politics and watch some entertainment only to have it shoved down my throat in Borat 2. Loved Borat 1 but #2 was an obvious political tool that sort of ruined the series. Now I\\'m not a conservative but it would have been nice for the movie to follow the entertainment style that it provided in its last movie without diving into politics and current events. Entertainment is meant to escape from what\\'s going on currently; not to immerse ourselves in political manipulation.,One star; basically an hour and a half long political commercial.,In the shadow of the first film totally lacking the light-hearted energy and comedy gold of the original.All the same set ups as the old one but it all seems so dull; the energy isn\\'t there; and there is nothing new to pull it along.It becomes tired early on and relies on the Rudy Giuliani interview at the end to keep people holding onto the end; and then that\\'s an even bigger let down.Glad I pay to see it in the cinema; COVID has it\\'s perks.,I loved the first Borat movie - it\\'s a classic.\\nBut \"Borat 2\" is an absolute rubbish.\\nI think I could only bear the first 30 min. of it.\\nIt\\'s so not funny.....like in all Hollywood movies now - comedy seems to be dead.,I was so excited about this but it was a disaster!,Had high expectations based on the previous ones... bad is an understament slow comedy bad quietly and extremely corny...,It is clear that it is politically motivated which is a shame; therefore score is equivalent to that... I enjoyed Sascha while ago; where he never took any part and he mocked everyone equally; but this is a clearly movie targeting right wing voters and party with hidden agenda and releasing it one week before elections. Enough said... Sascha obviously lost his touch and/or he joined the leftist \"train\" just to keep his career rolling (like many of other hollywood actors).Really shame to see that.,Fake; not funny; and ridiculously misrepresentative of Americans. BS like this is why Trump will win another term.,I came with expectations of laughter and went out with disappointment,Don\\'t waste your time. Not funny like the original. Weak attempt to belittle conservatives.,A dreadful film full of desperate cheap laughs; it may have worked 13 years ago with the original but the format hasn\\'t aged well.\\nWas tough to even finish; don\\'t think I laughed or smiled at all throughout.Very disappointed.,This movie made every attempt to be funny; while being witty; and it was neither. It was painful to watch. Sacha Baron Cohen takes every possible liberal talking point and tries to make fun of conservative views.,This movie is even better than the first one............NOT!! Now that we all know the premise; after watching the first movie; the jokes all seem old and recycled. The first movie was funny because we loved watching people\\'s honest reaction to what they thought was a real documentary.Now; everyone is in on the joke so the jokes seem forced and not quite as \"real\". Having his daughter added to the mix just seemed like a desperate attempt to even get the movie made; as every knew who the Borat character really was; as shown in the beginning of the movie - with fans & autograph seekers wanting selfies taken with him.If you liked the first movie; like I did; I think you\\'ll be disappointed with this one.,Big fan of Borat; loved the first movie but what did i just watch!Terrible; boring; not funny; scripted; lazy! I think thats the end of cohen as a legitimate satirical comedian. He really lost the magic and the content is just dumb.I would rate this -10 if i could; thats how lazy the script writing; acting; content was!,Nothing like the first one;it raised a few giggles;but no laughs. Very politically biased;and obviously skewed in one direction. if you are fed up with this one sided bullying of people;and their voters;give this a strong pass;if you are of the type that is easilly manipulated by the likes of certain \"news\" organisations;and like to shout;or bark at people because you do not have a clear enough mentality to engage them in adult conversation;then you will love it. This \"movie\" is basically Baron Cohen in thick rimmed glasses;purple hair and a love Trumps hate placard in hand barking at the screen for ninety plus minutes.,One of the worst movie sequels I\\'ve ever seen. Totally played up on the gags of the original film and everything obviously scripted and staged. Cohen clearly was wanting a payday without having to create anything original.,Yawn....if you\\'re going to make a movie involving politics you at least need to poke fun at both sides (see the Hunt). Beyond that though; the humor Borat inspired worked because his character was so young and naive in the first one. With a much older Cohen; it\\'s much harder to pull off this role and get the same laughs. This is just the norm; Jim Carey can no longer pull off his Dumb and Dumber character as we saw. Chevy Chase lost all his humor around 40-50. Cohen must be hard up for money to go back to the Borat well.,It is fun; hilarious; the acting and improv is sound and commendable. It also offers a deeply troubling insight into what we are really willing to slide as our \\'normal\\'.And I am writing this review while just being half way through it.\\nBUT OH MY GOD I COULD NOT WAIT TO WRITE THIS REVIEW BECAUSE IT IS ALL OF THE ABOVE AND IT IS OUTRAGEOUS. I LOVE IT SO MUCH. WOOHOOO.,A sequel often is a disappointment 14 years a is a long time of expectations to build. Brave and brilliant with a heart while still being an interesting look at the world we live in.super sequel,I watched the first film the night before this came out & 14 years later that is still god dam hilarious! Now unfortunately watching that one first & then this the following night; was a lot to live up to & this film just didn\\'t..it felt like a crude dark attempt to make him relevant again; the originality of the first one wasn\\'t there; the American politics bashing was a bit lame as it\\'s like errr the rest are the world are gonna watch this & we don\\'t care about your biased views & digs at politicians it\\'s not funny to us; If anything it makes it less funny; more staged & quiet frankly a million miles away from the authenticity of the first. It really is a shame you couldn\\'t just leave it at that one film gem.,Garbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nGarbage\\nYes; this review was helpful.,Such a shame; I absolutely loved the first film. The character of Borat has been weaponized by the left wing propaganda machine. A lot of these \"people\" who didn\\'t know who he was were obviously actors. I\\'m all for poking fun at the right; but this film was completely biased in one direction and made zero jokes and held no one accountable on the left. You guys should have just stuck to spoofing people instead of the \"orange man bad\" default crutch everyone falls back on when they run out of ideas. That is what made the original such a great film; little if any political agenda. This film just felt very lazy. The only time I felt like the old borat was back was during the father daughter dance scene; f@cking hilarious. Hollywood please stop preaching to your audience; and ruining modern cinema. Stick to creative and fun story telling. Leave politics out of my leisure time.,Remember when Sasha Baron Cohen was inventive ; fearless ; original and above all very funny ; before he started wearing his woke heart on his sleeve ; this godawful film is as funny as a cry for help .\\nIt is literally a gag an hour ; and they seem to have been written by Jason Manford ; Mike Read ; Jo Brand and Ted Rogers .\\nMakes Robin\\'s Nest look like The Producers .,The second Borat movie is a huge disappointment. It is nothing more than a political statement that misses the humour and absurdity of the first movie.,Doesn\\'t serve much purpose besides reinforcing the \\'Central Asians are uncivilised barbarians\\' stereotype and being a political propaganda tool to meddle with the American elections.\\nKazakhstan deserves more than an apology; Sacha Baron Cohen and the Borat team owes the Kazakh folk reparations for the irreversible damage that this abomination had caused to the international reputation of the country.,Sasha might have been funny once; but he\\'s lost his edge; in fact I wouldn\\'t even call this a comedy film; its more like a Russian Propaganda film; we didn\\'t even make the end of the film; turned it off after 40 minutes. If anyone else is thinking about it; I wouldn\\'t bother; in fact watching paint dry would be more entertaining ....,I loved the first Borat movie but this second try is really a bomb. It\\'s not funny at all.,Waste of time. Not funny and schematic. Offensive in a wrong way suppose to make it fresh but it did not. It is boring and predictable.,Not a patch on the original; I don\\'t think I laughed at all. Very contrived and fake. Low budget; cheap,This is not a movie; but a try to make money of the first movie; and at the same time shoving leftish propaganda down the audiences throats. If you like that; you like that movie. If you like your comedies be... well... funny; this is a huge waste of time. But; sure; some people will off course be rich from this crap. But remember it\\'s your money and your time you are giving them.,I regret to waste my time to watch this ridiculous movie.,Lame; monotonous; and childish middle school humor. Xenophobic stereotyping of another culture; so the xenophobic ethnocentrists are sure to love it. Waste of time at best.,It doesnt work like it did in the first! Politics just garbage. I cant sit through more past 23 minute just uggg no!!,Horrible tasteless humor. I couldn\\'t make it through the entire movie which contained juvenile humor and excruciating graphic display of female menstruation. Sasha Baron Cohen needs to find a new shtick! The only bright spot in this disaster of a movie is Maria Bakalova who should be a rising star if she can keep away from horrible productions such as this!,Probably a bad idea to watch before a dodger game but this was really bad. It\\'s not like his previous work of comedy. Everything was flat; fake scenes; fake chop; audio misplacement. Was a borat fan for part 1 but this whole movie was a snooze fest,Amm; this is beyond bad; unwatchable. Wasn\\'t a big fan of the first; but it was ok. This; just amazingly dismal.,This was the most cringe-worthy rubbish to be touted as comedy I have ever watched. Puerile; toilet humour that did nothing make me smile once. Someone pad a lot of money to make this film; and to have an untalented lead to front it.,This movie was too scripted compared to the original Borat.Also period blood is not funny it\\'s gross,The original was something new and had funny moments.\\nThis is like a comedian trying to make you laugh with the tenth retelling of a joke you already know. It\\'s no longer funny. And once the humor is gone; we are just left with mean spirited scenarios trying to mock and belittle unsuspecting people. I found it incredibly boring. I think I broke a smile a few times but I hope this is the end of Borat. It\\'s like Cohen is a one trick pony rehashing used setups. Time for something original.,I\\'m afraid I am only reviewing an hour as I turned this mess off.The original was a masterpiece; had me howling with laughter. This is absolute garbage; majority of it is scripted crap and the rest was poor.Nothing like the original please don\\'t go into this movie thinking you are going to get the same as part one.Rubbish.,Spoiler alert - I am not a Trump supporterI really enjoyed the original Borat - it was clever; funny & impactful - this character in the original movie reminded me of the role of the court jester - to speak truth to power.This follow up movie was shockingly disturbing.I felt gross after watching it.Sacha Cohen crossed the line in multiple ways in his attempt to make his points.His points are true & valid.His approach with this movie was dark; disrespectful & disturbing.As the court jester; he has such incredible talent & a global platform.This was just awful.,Unfortunately most of the jokes aren\\'t funny and story is so boring,Movie is total garbage; nothing shocking or new... Just banking on profanity...Story is absolutely predictable which it should not be for a borat movie...,Most of the jokes seem forced and designed to make a political point. The entire point of the movie is to paint mainstream Americans as dumb and worthless. The first one was actually funny; this one; not so much.,Loved the first one. Hate this one. Released before elections of course.,Then this movie is perfect for you. This is old school pranksters; knocking inside open anti-Trump doors. Boring if you are tired of this.,Loved it and laught first time; but this time... Cohen\\'s jokes are very outdated and worn out; everything is based on old kindergarten-level jokes for morons and for perverts. Always the same deranged jokes about supposedly endangered Jews and gays and mocking republicans but he does not dare to criticize leftists; Antifa terrorists; BLM or their politicians. Very politically colored; biased to the far left. And this with Giuliani is the only thing that raised dust in this miserable piece of trash. But actually it is nothing interesting. It\\'s all about Giuliani really adjusting his pants and microphones (the actress was helping him) and that was nothing indecent or shocking. And that\\'s actually the whole plot of all this rubbish - how to cheat and mock Republicans and Conservatives. Utterly disaster for low IQ children. Cohen is not funny any more and it is time somebody to tell him that.,The 10 star reviews will likely be from the whiny; entitiled Democrats of the US and A with an IQ of about the same as a potato and even Canadians like myself know exactly which backwards States they\\'re from. (cough California and New York),I remember watching Borat as a teen when it first came out. The whole crowd in the cinema was laughing almost all the way threw the movie. It was new it was unbelievably funny and it was so original. If you have not watched the second part please do the original movie and yourself a huge favor and DONT watch it! It\\'s basically an anti Trump movie right before the elections; but I don\\'t get the point. Will anyone watch it and believe that it\\'s not staged? The first movie was not that was clear but this? What\\'s the point of the part when he goes in the synagogue dressed as a Jew when it is know that the the lady who are there already knew that this was a set up? Wasn\\'t even funny. Who believes that the part when the three of them are in quarantine and come up with a song that he sings a day after is not staged? The whole movie seems fake and I can\\'t remember one part that was actually funny. Too bad he did a second part ; I hope he does not ruin Bruno if Trump wins the election... The worst is the way they edited the whole movie ; just check how the real rally he attended happened... Do your self a favor; and don\\'t watch it.,I don\\'t even know where to start. Ali G was awesome; OG Borat was awesome; Dictator was OK and this is the worst movie I watched in a long time. It\\'s like watching someone else trying to copy Borat and fails miserably. Maybe I had high expectations. Wouldn\\'t recommend to anyone except die hard fans to who the name of the movie is enough.,So they created a sex scandal with a prominent public figure. That is in no way comedy; it wasn\\'t even in her character.While the first movie was great with its absurdity; the way they tried to outdo themselves in this one came out mostly infantile; as if it was fan fiction. But was entertaining at times and the segment with ballroom was hysterical and very masterfully done.It all fell apart when the interview came along. Tutar completely fell out of character when she started using her actual real-world charms and gestures (that rub on his knee) as a lead in to get him into that bedroom. If she was in actual character; she would have pulled her pants down and showed him her bloody bush right there during the actual interview; asking him to marry her. Really disgusting what they did there. Everyone is now preoccupied with analyzing how some guy put his hand in his pants after a gorgeous woman dragged him into a bedroom and went on to \"remove his mic\".,Why why why?\\nFor as funny as the original borax movie was this is a contrived mess\\nBad editing to try and gain more impact\\nIf you\\'ve never seen the original 2006 movie\\nWatch that instead of this utter rubbishA movie title that should have been one and done,I think the charm that borat was searching for was to display a hilariously offensive character in the world and political climate of 2020. They managed to create some pretty funny scenarios for Borats character to encounter with clever writing; and great improvisation from the actors. Where the film kind of fell apart for me; was that they were trying to portray many of the scenes as if they were raw reactions and takes with \"real people\". They had scenes in department stores; health clinics; and other every day locations. Although it becomes glaringly apparent that the people Borat talks to are actors; or at least playing a part. It gives the film a feeling of inauthenticity and detracts from what I believe they are trying to do. At times the film also blurs the lines between what is clever and funny; and what is just unsettling and gross. Given the timing of this film and the US elections; it feels uninspired and rushed. Entertaining at times; but falls flat,The first one was witty and funny. The second is just lame!!!!,I\\'d say at least 95% of the negative reviews are coming from Trumpers and the right. Wonder why that is? They go around spewing their hate in droves and hate anything that tells facts about their leader! They also hate anything with diversity. Click on one of their profiles and I guarantee you that all their negative reviews are about shows that have any diversity in it. I have and it\\'s sickening. Just scroll down their reviews and they give any show that has a person of color; woman; gay person; etc a 1 or 2. They can\\'t stand that the world is changing and for the better!,This is a poor offering. There are a few mildly funny bits but the casual racism and gross bottom of the barrel subject matter had me turning the thing off half way through. Trump and Trumpism are ripe for parody but there are a thousand better ways to do it than this; which feels like it\\'s been written by a 12 year old boy who thinks he is being daring.,Don\\'t waste your time. Not even funny. Baron Cohen is just an activist; Jokes are political. If you are a liberal you will love it but if you are one of the common people you\\'ll find it disgusting.,Very much the Emperors New Clothes here; this is not social nor political commentary.The subjects are not the smartest of people. He doesn\\'t laugh with; he laughs at.What makes it worse; is Sascha Baron Cohen is a very competent actor; his turn in The Spy was excellent. And he spends his time making this?,Borat no make much funny movie. It stink from many no fun liberal poke at people Borat not fit to lick boots. No like much this movie because it no make me laugh. Borat just confused liberal making stinky movie for other confused liberals.,I actually enjoyed the first movie; but half way through this disaster of a movie; I just skipped ahead to see if it got better or even funny - I didn\\'t laugh at all. The political agenda is blatant and honestly mean spirited; one sided and NOT FUNNY!,Another Cohen masterpiece.. it\\'s obvious from the one star reviews that he was right on target.,The original Borat is the funniest movie I have seen. You could tell the interactions were genuine; and the movie didn\\'t have a political agenda. Unfortunately Borat 2 is nothing more than a political statement with interactions that seemed scripted. It is basically just a long anti Trump commercial.The addition of his daughter really hurt the movie too. She was not funny; and her acting obviously ruined any potentially authentic reactions. The only funny parts in the movie were when it was just Borat.,This is a lame sequel to a great original. While the original is well researched with solid characters; the Borat in this one is a man who is lost between being authentic character he was; and just another normal guy.Laughs are forced; with the exception of a couple of places where it is the usual Sacha.\\nAs a Sacha Baron Cohen fan; this was an utter disappointment.,Wow what did they do to borat?Its basically an anti trump propaganda movie.,The movie starts off well but anything that\\'s funny about the movie takes place in the first 10 minutes.\\nAfter that the movie is just a bad editing of poorly planned scenes together.\\nThe first movie was amazing but subsequent moviefilm reaches greater heights - Not!,I think you need to get Borat to see the funny side of this. The Americans are mesmerisingly obliging - no matter what they are asked to do and Borat and his daughter might as well be aliens. Hilarious.,Just such a waste of time.. not even funny; just cringe :/,The film seems rushed out and unfinished.I laughed for the first 8 minutes; silly voice; funny dialogue; odd Kazakhstan customs; then watched and cringed; and didn\\'t laugh as the scripted set pieces rolled in.Possible spoilers; but i doubt it.....I don\\'t get baby/doctor scene; why was this clever or funny; not explaining someone has swallowed a plastic toy and then expecting us to laugh at the poor doctor trying to help because he thinks the girls pregnant. The set up was poor and the joke was worse.Other scenes equally poor.Turned off after 56minutes.,Straight away I noticed his Borat voice was so poorly done. Sacha\\'s English accent kept slipping through and was just crap and off-putting. Lazy and rushed.This entire movie was a total $hit show from start to finish. Unfunny; pathetic stunts and pranks and unfunny dialogue. The period scene for example and saying to a doctor he put a baby inside his daughter....just not funny; and I\\'m no prudeIts a liberal propaganda film pathetically half disguised as a \\'comedy\\' yet theres nothing funny in Borat 2.Borat 2 is worlds away from the very funny original Borat. I felt depressed as hell after watching Borat 2. Sacha is a sell out shill and only made Borat 2 as a smear campaign against Trump.Pathetic film making.,An excellent movie; very enjoyable 👍 good job ✨ totally fully loaded with jokes. I have spent a Great time watching it. Good msg sent to the world. Positive.,Yeah that is a good movie watch you will enjoy it and will hate republican party forever!\\nand sacha really have noooo limit for his job and humer. his just wonderfulll!,Borat is back with a vengeance! Yes it\\'s more of the same sort of thing you\\'d expect but it still keeps you on the edge of your seat cringing (in a good way) throughout!The Rudy Giuliani scene is worth the wait. Believe me.I think Maria Bakalova has a bright future ahead of her as she seriously challenges Baron Cohen as to who is actually the funniest on this movie!I never thought we\\'d get a Borat sequel let alone one that actual managed to deliver.,I mean seriously the part one had genuinely funny moments and the whole concept itself made you wonder if it\\'s actually a movie or something that really happened! It was crazy and spot on.\\nPart 2 tries HARD to get the same going but fails in almost every aspect! Even the jokes feel lame and not original.\\nIf not for being bored; I don\\'t think would have even bothered to finish off the movie.\\nOverall; you can easily skip this one with absolutely NO REGRETS of having to miss on anything special.,It\\'s hilarious and brilliantly written; acted and improvised. It\\'s timing is impeccable. So awkward but in a good way.,Some laughs but mainly just something to skip through,This movie was so ridiculous it was painful to watch!,Even looking past the political propaganda bs; this movie was hard to watch more than half the time. All the daughter bits were boring. If he had made fun of both political sides; this movie could\\'ve been better. Imagine the reactions he would\\'ve gotten if he\\'d gone to a BLM rally dressed in MAGA merch. If he crashed a Biden rally; made fun of pelosi. Those would\\'ve been huge laughs. I\\'m not even really that bothered by the Trump jokes; but don\\'t be so biased about it. Go for both parties equally.,In my opinion Sacha baron cohen is one of the best comedians of all time; he\\'s an absolute genius and yes of course the second borat is really great and i enjoyed it so much.,Hilarious! Brilliant; bold; exposing! Real! The Bulgarian actress was perfect. The set up scenes were so well planned out. So much thought went into it. Perfectly exposes the current culture of humanity.,Whilst I appreciate that this is supposedly a satirical look at the USA I find it quite deplorable to continue to play into the hands of the Holocaust deniers. Also; the ridiculous amount of sexism & antisemitism is so shameful that I\\'d bet even Jim Davidson & the rest of the British 1970\\'s comedians would wince at.,Just a piece of democratic publicity. Horrible. Totally unfunny,Don\\'t waste your time. So obviously a set up with professional actors and not the slightest bit funny. The sets are so sparse and staged.,This was a good one time watch but it is is no way a match to the predecessor . Sure it does has its own funny scenes a lot of them but sometimes it felt as if the screen were scripted and even if they aren\\'t they lacked the surprise thing/unpredictability like in the first part .Sacha Cohen was amazing as always with his comedic timing ; the girl also did a pretty decent job . Overall a good one time watch .,None of the humor or charm of the original.\\nThis exaggerated corpse is brought back to life solely to awkwardly push a heavy handed political message.,Far more politically exposing than the first; Borat 2 is a raw expose of US power and political relations far beyond slapstick humour. The inconsistencies in American right-wing factional thought; mysogynism and the moral laxity of an uninformed; conspiracy theory touting conservative base is brought to light with some intelligent humour and outright outrageous scenes. This is smarter than a mere 90 mins of pranks -- this is a message of how compromised American democracy is today.,Waited all this time for this; sat down with friends ready to cringe and laugh; and either we all just got old between films; or we loved it; and just couldn\\'t laugh through our masks. A couple of strong laughs; but I\\'m reading reviews saying 9/10 and wondering what these people watched. No Luenell Either? I\\'m seeing that the bad reviews are woke and saying \"Republicans or rednecks won\\'t like it\" of course people have to get political and not just watch it; and what would republicans be mad about; Giuliani scene was cringey more than funny; and if you didn\\'t want to hang out with the cabin boys after; you clearly are enjoying 2020 being locked in. From my group what I could tell is; if you liked the daughter character you liked it a lot; if you didn\\'t; obviously you won\\'t. I probably should give it a 4; or a 7; but I guess to me it was like watching the sixth sense a second time. That\\'s probably a dumb analogy; but I couldn\\'t get past the novelty had worn off. I think I laughed more the 5 minutes before we watched it; talking about Borat 1; then during.,As much as I wanted this to be good; it was a disaster. the reports and reviews from others really got me excited; those folks need to broaden their horizons if this is doing it for them. I found the whole way through was a struggle to stay engaged; the humour was mild and few and far between... all in all forget this one SBC,As someone who would not be too offended by much or on any political divide I feel I am worthy of a fairly unbiased review. This film is truly atrocious. It speaks volumes that he had to return to an old character which lets be honest is past its sell by date. Whether this was because SBC is stuck for new material; money or is so desperate to push his own political agenda...it doesn\\'t really matter; it should still be somewhat intelligent and entertaining. It\\'s not; it\\'s crass; crude; dumb toilet humour; fart jokes included. If this is your thing; go watch some of the scary movie series; at least that doesn\\'t want to ram some political agenda down your throat at the same time as having to watch pure dumb unfunny muck.,I\\'m not a political person at all. Don\\'t lean one way or the other with it. It\\'s just not something that interests me.Unfortunately; this film just is all about bashing the president... and that\\'s all. Honestly; though; it\\'s not about the subject matter.. it could have been about anything; It\\'s that it\\'s like the same joke over and over and it just gets tired.Did not seem like Borat at all.,The first movie was very good and made fun of everyone and everything. This new one is a reflection of the political bias of pop culture in today\\'s society. I laughed at several parts but this has nowhere near the comedy of the first.It\\'s very one sided. I\\'m pretty centrist but I could tell how biased this movie is. They only went after republicans. I wish that he would have gone after Democrats and their supporters too.I was thinking maybe he would go after the other side but it never happened. He just mocked Trump supporters by finding the most extreme ones. The ending just seemed like a very anti American message much like everything coming out of Hollywood today.This movie was good for a few good laughs but that\\'s about it. I think Sasha Baren Cohen could\\'ve done so much better,It had extreme political views compared with Borat 1; I think his daughter was a waste of time in the movie but probably the movie was motivated by feminists. It had very pro-Zionist views on things.,I loved the first but this was terrible. The inclusion of his daughter was unneeded. By all means; have another character for Borat to interact with but get somebody who can do improv. His daughter ruined many scenes by laughing as Baron Coen ad-libbed. Too many scripted scenes and the terrible disguises (apparently needed because he is such a recognisable character now) ruin it.,Seems to have been made with an agendaI used to like most of his filmsBiggest laugh is some hair on the armpits if you find that funny,From the Russian Hoax; to Biden sniffing people; to cancel culture - the left wasn\\'t touched with a 10 ft pole.\\nIt not only was all \\'Trump-centric\\' - it wasn\\'t based upon the real jokes to be made; it was based upon the caricature of the right that the left tell themselves is the truth.\\nAnd the worst part - that was the funniest parts.\\n70% of the movie is about him and his daughter; with the same joke being rehashed 100 different ways.\\nIf you liked the 1st Borat; it is at least watchable for a one-time viewing; so I gave it 3/10. But I\\'d watch the 1st 100xs over before ever watching this again.,I liked it; everyone gets so upset when their political views get made fun of. It\\'s fine; people have opposing views. I like jokes about both sides and borat 2 had me cracking up and uncomfortable; overall it was very enjoyable. 8/10 but I\\'m offsetting the 1/10 votes by people who can\\'t take a joke,Don\\'t waste your time ; absolute drivel ; enjoyed the first one but this is completely unfunny,At least the first one had some funny moments just because of the absurd nature of the scenes and his anonymity.This one is unfunny; cliched and just plain stupid. And of course it\\'s supposed to be a hatchet job on republicans; but even clever editing and out of context footage can\\'t save this piece of crap.Not worth a watch.,SBC used to be funny and ground breaking; this is just tired same old shock you with cringe stuff that\\'s really not amusing; laced with the woke narrative that Hollywood can\\'t do without; disappointing and dull,I laughed a few times at the start of the movie and then I realised it was rubbish. Such a shame. I was well up for a good laugh. Didn\\'t happen.,With any SBC film you kinda know what you\\'re going to get; and this doesn\\'t disappoint. It is simultaneously hilarious; uncomfortable; genius; depraved; and jaw dropping in its brutal exposure of ignorance.The highlight is actually the actor who plays Borats daughter (Maria Balakova) Great performance and very gutsy lady to perform like that under what must be bizarre circumstances. Also; the scene shot in a Synagogue with a pair of elderly Jewish ladies is very touching indeed.It\\'s obvious that filming was caught out by Covid; and the ending a little rushed; but overall it works very well.,I\\'ve watched it at least 3 times this week! Hilarious! Plays off the first one fantastically!,Borat: do you like my new MovieFilm ?Me: yesBorat: it is great like my previous MovieFilm ?Me: supBorat: 👍🏻 !VERY NICE!👍🏻,The original Borat; I watched 20+ times; loved it. But this new one really is terrible. Not funny at all.,This movie is even better than the first one; I laughed so much; and humor is very dark; I definitely recommend you to watch it ;),Funny with some really hilarious moments; with one or two slow bits preventing me giving a 10.,If you laugh while pulling off wings of flies; this is for you. It\\'s a poor; uninspired repeat of the first movie. Making fun of Southerners (already done); Texans (done); and Republicans (done again). I don\\'t know if this was purely a money grab or political panic from just another Hollywood creator.,I\\'m not a US citizen; not a Repulican nor a fan of Trump. Having said that this movie feels lazy; safe; boring; predictable and extremely one sided. Being released so close to elections it\\'s not even trying to hide its intentions. It\\'s picking the most easiest targets. The Christians and Republicans. What\\'s so brave about that? Of course there will be no consequences. If he wanted to make something meaningful; he should\\'ve mixed it up a bit. There are many things to expose about American society; or society in general; on either side of the argument. Of course people on the other side of spectrum; people who are not mocked here; will like it. And they are not entirely virtuous and without flaws. Not entirely blameless. And what\\'s so righteous about that? Mocking people on the other side and not being entirely truthful. Where is the risk? Where is the effort? People who agree with him will say it\\'s funny; it\\'s great; and people who disagree will hate it. Like I said in the beginning. Lazy; safe; boring; predictable; makes me sick is what it is.,Its ironic that the movie is about an actor who is deceiving the supposedly less intelligent members of the southern united states as I\\'m assuming the audience won\\'t be those who have been targeted in the movie leaving the \\'intelligent\\' northerners to enjoy the movie?This brings me to my point; which is simply that to enjoy the movie you would have to either have an I.Q lower than the national average or have an I.Q still in development i.e that of a child but as the movie is rated \\'R\\' I\\'m going to assume no responsible parent would let their child watch the movie. So who the movie is aimed at is quite the mystery.The critics reviews are also perplexing as reading their reviews they talk about an average movie at best which gets good in the last half hour if you stick with it but its not as good as the first and yet they are still awarding it 4 or 4.5 star out of 5Its clear there is an agenda in the movie but it seems utterly lost in a what is a confusing movie. It shows a lot of shops selling things to Borat and his daughter and ignoring anything they say to make the sale; is that a dig at capitalism or just the greed of humanity?It shows a woman showing genuine concern for Borat\\'s daughter and her proposed plastic surgery and her lack of understanding of her body.It shows the Russel family take in a foreigner during a national epidemic and tolerate his cultural differences; it also tries to highlight their \\'southern prejudices\\' as they talk about Democrats drinking blood.It then shows Borat in disguise singing a song about injecting the virus and the crowd are singing along then the Russel family help to reunite Borat and his daughter.I wanted to turn the movie off after the first twenty minutes but having read the reviews I stuck with it to see the good last half hour but even then its just a slog.Honestly; the only shocking thing about this movie is the high reviews its been getting.,Quoting the NY Times: He said he moved in with two conspiracy theorists for a few days to show \"that they\\'re ordinary folks who are good people; who have just been fed this diet of lies\".Well if Cohen is not feeding us lies here; he probably has done QAnon a favor. Those guys are clearly in on the joke and indeed look agreeable besides Borat. I bet they do not regret a single word. It actually looks like *they* got *him* to sing their Wuhan flu song at the rally.The movie has some funny moments but this - together with the absolutely irresponsible attempt at Giuliani - ruined it for me.,Don\\'t listen to critics so much and form your own opinions; anyone with no sense of humor will pick this movie apart,Sacha has lost his touch ; definitely trying to push an agenda and isn\\'t even funny while doing it. Borat was one of the best movies I\\'d ever seen. This is a terrible follow up.,It\\'s unbelievable how extreme today\\'s views in politics have become. Hopefully this movie gets a few people thinking,Awesome and a complete fun ride in entirety. Best Comic Actor there is ; Good Direction and Actress did good too .\\nLove you Borat :),This movie has an obvious political agenda and ain\\'t afraid to hide it. The show provides the viewers an illusion of honest interactions between Borat and (supposedly) average American Republicans who appears to be oblivious to the cameras. For a movie that tries to get authentic reactions felt like it missed the bar and paid. The only people I found authentic are the doctor at the pro life clinic; the Trump supporters at the rally and all of them who got their faces blurred at the concert. ***SPOILERS**** Besides that the only authentic reaction from a person that I believe is Rudy Giuliani where Borat\\'s daughter took advantage of Giuliani\\'s kindness (and naivety) by pretending to be a journalist and having an interview with him. After the interview has concluded you can see Borat\\'s daughter setting up Giuliani by pretending to help him remove the wires from his clothes. Then Borat rushes into the room saying to take him instead of his daughter insinuating that Giuliani is a creep who is willing to get in bed with an underage girl (at least to the audience with heavy and nearly perfect editing).Sure the movie is funny at times and had some good cringe worthy scenes in there. But it ain\\'t enough to redeem it especially when there is a decisive motive behind it. Like one scene in the movies insinuates black trump supporters complementing trump on twitter of Facebook are fake and made by spammers from a third world country. Sure laughter brings people together but the laughter that Cohen provides is one that\\'s only decisive and adds fuel to the fire.,Well just finished watching Borat Subsequent Moviefilm and it was absolutely hilarious. I\\'m guessing the reviewers leaving 1-star reviews don\\'t understand satire; there\\'s no doubt clever people will get it. The ending wraps it up nicely with dare I say a fulfilling sense of pride. Very much a product of its time; and I for one am looking forward to revisiting it in five or ten years time and reflecting back on this period we\\'re all going through.\\nAnd; why do people say \"I couldn\\'t even watch 10 minutes of it\" and then leave a review? YOU\\'RE NOT QUALIFIED if you don\\'t watch the whole thing! It really demonstrates the unintelligence of the \"reviewer\".,Their motives are very transparent. Rushed out in order to influence the 2020 election results. And not even funny! I\\'m greatly disappointed.,I absolutely adored the original as it was shown for everyone and the jokes were amazingly offensive meanwhile staying funny.\\nI\\'m not sensitive at all and I laugh at absolutely everything that\\'s deemed horrible to others; but\\nThe second one.\\nIt just applies to Americans. Good thing I watched it through a trial and not on a subscription as it was not worth it at all.\\nThere were exactly 4 times I laughed at this movie. The most at the Jewish part in the church(But also only the beginning) and the very end when they\\'re reporting.\\nThis was such an American propaganda it was painful for me to watch.\\nAlmost all the movie was scripted unlike the original and it was not funny.\\nThe original one had genuine reactions from people but this was just plain and boring.\\nI wouldn\\'t even think about watching this dumpsterfire again. I\\'d rather watch the original for the nth time.,There were a couple funny parts; but really this is a juvenile movie that set out to make fun of American conservatives. The humor is very cringey; and appeals mostly to an immature audience.,I couldn\\'t even get through the first half hour; he\\'s alot older now and his borat voice is shot. The voice alone ruined it for me. Maybe ill try again in a few days.,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel that\\'s as good; if not better; than it\\'s predecessor. It\\'s reliably funny; shocking and extremely relevant. Sacha Baron Cohen is once again perfect with Maria Bakalova giving an equally fearless performance. The majority of the jokes are really funny and shocking making up for the few that aren\\'t as good. It\\'s extremely well paced and Jason Woliner\\'s direction is great. The music by Erran Baron Cohen is fantastic.,This movie is the absolute disgrace.Within 30 minutes of watching I realized I had no idea what Im watching and just turned it off.There was absolutely nothing funny about it; no jokes; no laughs; just one disgraceful non funny joke after the other.This is absolutely the worst type of cinema one can get.,Borat. This was some Michelangelo level humor. I\\'m a fan for life. Thank you for giving the world something to laugh at during this pandemic.,I watched this sequel to the first Borat movie and I wholeheartedly recommend this one. It has a well written storyline while speaking volumes regarding the American condition. His costar as his daughter is captivating and believable and the whole film is actually told with heart if you can belive that. When you can; check out the many back stories regarding the making of the film which will give incredible insight to it\\'s making on Youtube.,As always Cohen delivers a gem! This has a plot and well designed story line that carved its humor like a slice of apple pie!,I enjoy this movie! For sure it is not the best comedy of the century but can make you laugh.,Had the same humor as the first one but seemed much more thought out and planned; and the girl that played the daughter was great! So crazy that Sacha Baron Cohen got the Vp and the presidents lawyer like that lol,Well done Sacha Baron Cohen. This movie really made me laugh from the heart. Thank you also for choosing the best actress for your daughter. As a Bulgarian and mostly her friend; I am really pround and happy. You all deserve nominations and Oscar\\'s! I cannot believe how hard it was to act all the time and do such a great performance. I am waiting the next movies of her with big impatience. I always knew it she will climb to the top of Hollywood some day. And here is the day. This movie made me very very happy.,Unlike the first movie this movie is just democratic party agenda and attacking trump and the republicans . a very weak sequel . it aint funny at all there are some funny moments but in comparison to borat 1 its nothing,I love Sacha Barron but this movie is completely a disaster. if you respect for your time don\\'t even come close to this movie.,I LOVED Borat when it first came out. I was a huge fan that first movie I could NOT... and I mean NOT stop laughing. So with this one I was expecting it to be hilarious just as the first one. And I GOT that. Everything that Sacha did was hilarious and his daughter played by Maria Bakalova was brilliant in the movie ; I swear I though she WAS Sacha\\'s daughter. They both played it so good. Everything made me laugh and it was so funny to a pulp. Is it better than the first movie.... NO. Was it just as good.... Yes. This movie has the most offensive stuff in it. From Women to race to gender to everything even the pandemic was JOKED in this movie. PLEASE if you get easily offended.... please don\\'t bother on watching it. I for one can take a joke of race;gender; sexualty etc. I though this film did it\\'s best and it is one of my favorite of 2020 (Not saying much since a lot have left 2020 to 2021) 9/10.,This is the best documentary of 2020...much more well-researched and fact-based than Plandemic!,This movie is nothing but stupid. No witty puns; double entendres; zingers; just more of Borat being crude beyond measure. Adolescent humor at its lowest.,The main source of pleasure from watching any segment of Borat (or movie in general) is watching \"normal\" people who find themselves in unfamiliar situations trying to get out of such difficult circumstances. The first Borat was mostly apolitical; interested in exposing American hypocrisy. Well; as it happens; the truth is stranger than fiction; even if the concept of truth simply does not exist in this case. The continuation; of course; is more like a propaganda campaign for Biden; but it must be said that it took Cohen 14 years to get Borat back on the screens. Realizing that this character was a victim of his own success and could no longer fool people; the Kazakh reporter\\'s sequel is exhumed with all possible cynicism: he has evolved in the right direction and is not a blind copy of the original; yet the sequel has added interesting; relevant ideas to the modern world.,Wow. my jaw was dropped for a large portion of this movie. and it had me cracking up throughout. like a continuation of Who Is America? but with our favorite character. i\\'ve said this before and i\\'ll say it again... sacha baron cohen is a genius. no one can do what he does. he is amazing at it.i never thought we\\'d get another borat movie after the original destroyed the world of comedy (top 2 comedy of all time). but we did. and it was amazing. (1 viewing; 10/23/2020),I\\'m not going to lie; it\\'s mad impressive that the Redneck song was somehow way funnier in the actual context of this movie than watching it happen in real life all those months ago.,You can go for its awesome so many valgur scene buy funny too just keep that in mind,Not sure who this film is for...obviously not me. While I enjoyed the first one; the second film isn\\'t all that funny. If you want shocking; this is your film. If you want to see the genitals of a monkey (No; Really) this is your film. Pretty tasteless actually. But I\\'ll give it to Borat; the film has its funny moments; and when I say funny I mean gut busting. Maybe I\\'ll give the film a second chance. But until then my rating stands. Heck I\\'d rather watch Joker (2019) again and I despise that movie. Watch at your own risk. If you want to fully enjoy the film; watch it with your spouse or friends. I watched it with my mom. She was appalled by what was happening in the film. She thought the previews were funny but the film not so much. Vile; disgusting; humorous; horrible; unique and it shows the true flaws of America. As I said before; not my film. And definitely not my mommas film. So guess who will be in church Sunday? This guy....,This is nothing more than Baron Cohen being the political activist he is. Still kinda funny but it\\'s a shame the virtue signalers of hollyweird keep pushing their entitled narrative,This movie was incredible I haven\\'t laughed this hard at a movie in years!! I highly recommend watching it,I loved this film; was happy to see the Macon purity ball put on blast. Thank you for doing what you do Sasha!,Sasha Baron Cohen is back as Borat; the intrepid journalist; and this time he mostly takes on McDonald Trump and Mike Pence. If you are a MAGA hat wearing viewer; you will be offended; but for all others; you will love Borat. It begins with our star in a gulag for offending his nation in the first film. He is released to bring honor to his nation by delivering a gift to Mike Pence. At first it is a monkey but later turns out to be his teenage daughter. Not as good as the first film; but still very funny.,I had to see this subsequent moviefilm in a slightly inebriated state of mind. I didn\\'t wanna watch this sober. But I laughed. And I laughed. Many times. Borat delivered again. I would have given it a higher mark than a 7 if it wasn\\'t for the Giuliani part. That segment felt a bit like an unfair ambush.\\nMaria Bakalova; however; did great. Kudos to her!,Should come with a warning; if you\\'re not interested in American politics give it a miss.,It\\'s a drag. Starts out pretty good with some laughs in great Borat style. But where the first movie carried momentum through seemingly unscripted events which felt true; this sequel is 100% scripted.,I forced myself to watch it to the very end with some hope that the movie would prove me wrong. Sadly I was wrong and I feel robbed for wasting my time and endured so much pain and torture with this horror film. The Borat sequel film is nothing like the original film It stinks more than rotting flesh and feels like you are receiving a lobotomy with every minute of watching it. It\\'s like Sacha had nothing at all to do with the production except play a roll. I\\'m actually embarrassed for Sacha and myself. Wow. If there is a god; let it remove this movie from Earth and all existence.,That\\'s the real October surprise\\nHe showed the real red necks and the real Qnaon stories,This film was everything I expected; and in 2020 the humour of this film on my screen just makes it so much better; hopefully this can be the start of this sort of humour bringing its way back; yes people will complain because they have nothing better to do with their lives; but if you\\'re like me and enjoy laughing then don\\'t hesitate to watch this movieVERY NICE,I had never seen a Borat film before and only did so this time because of the media buzz. While I did not find the film very funny; I absolutely loved how the film exposed the hypocrisy of sleazy old Rudy. He lied about not doing \"anything inappropriate.\" Aside from that; there were scenes I did not find funny but rather gross.,I thought the first film was ok; funny but just a bit much; I found this one to actually be really smart; I\\'m unsure how much of its staged; I mean the Rudy bit especially is just scary dodgy; I\\'m from the uk and I feel for Americans; such a huge country obviously differs from here but with guns; morons in charge and the vast gap in education between areas I couldn\\'t imagine a worse place to live. I know parts are ok but being real it\\'s just a dangerous place.The truths here were close to home but true; I saw so many rallies during lockdown in the USA compared to few if any here; I actually agree the virus is man made; I think the bat things just a lie. 2020 has been horrific and at times where many countries came together the USA is divided. Joke of a president who deserves jail... or drinking disinfectant,You either like SCB or you don\\'t . I thought the movie wad hilarious and Borat and his daughter were a great duo . Obviously some are not going to like it but if you like a little satire in this scary time it\\'s a great laugh .,I am amazed by all forms of media in the last couple of years provide no escape from politics. I just wan to watch something to leave reality behind for a few.,I hope he never stops making those films. Yes they are daring and extreme but also shows the truth. Fantastic that he exposed the old creeps,While I had some good laughs; recording people without their consent is not ethical. It will get media attention and good sell/revenue; but that\\'s not ethical way to make money in my opinion!! I would also argue there is hidden political agenda in making of this movie!! Just not best 2 hours of my life!!,Usually when you watch a good comedy; you just laugh the whole time.Sadly for this movie; I cringed more times than I laughed. Not funny at all; especially the Holocaust prank.,There were a few moments when I laughed; but Borat as a character isn\\'t relevant anymore. He doesn\\'t have that anonymity to fool people and the situations are incredibly staged.,Bit disappointed with this film; I guess the character has reached the end of the road. I loved the first movie and most of Baron Cohen\\'s characters but this one felt a bit forced and not as funny as before.,I couldn\\'t believe they were going to make another borat movie; nor did I expect it to be as good as the first one; it\\'s a very good movie. If you like dark humor you really have to see it.,Borat is back; with this subsequent moviefilm. This will be compared to the original to no end; but with borat being a cultural icon in America; this one was bound to be very different.I loved this film; it made me topple with laughter multiple times. The accomplishment of making this within a pandemic is also a massive achievement. Do I think this is better then the first one? No. Do I think this is a hilarious movie? Absolutely.,How many people have been offended by this film gets an extra star for making Leigh Francis weep.Great film!!!!!,I loved the first one and this one is just as good. It may have been a little more staged; but I laughed as much as the last.The rating is so obviously being brought down by a certain type. Why do they bother to watch it at all; knowing what this satire is about?I actually liked the ending of this one better; probably because of the scripting. Nonetheless; good for a laugh.,The best funny film of 2020 is not at a theater near you (even closed cinemas in NYC and LA) but on your Fire Tablet and TV and also the prime video app on consoles and smart tvs. It\\'s Borat Subsequent Moviefilm; the sequel to the box office surprise hit Borat from 2006 which was the first movie I saw at the AMC in Rockaway; NJ during its opening weekend and have since seen it a few times on DVD and on TV. 14 years after the original; about a Kazakhstan man making fun of the USA; finds Borat on a mission to find Rudy Guiliani and his GOP friends on a quest to raise his daughter which soon gets lost. Hilariousness ensues and there\\'s lots of jokes and action in just 90+ minutes. Highly recommended and it might be nominated for some Oscar bait!!!,In an interview with Good Morning America Cohen admits that he believes the Giuliani was only fixing his shirt. But he tells then also that people are allowed to interpret for themselves. It is undeniable how uncomfortable Sacha is willing to push people to be so open. In the last movie I felt i comfy and shocked by the things people sad but I wasn\\'t completely thrown aback. The faces we see and recognize in this wonderful concoction of modern fear are haunting. It\\'s not just an innocent bystander. It\\'s topical and it\\'s brutally raw. Sadly it is a little one sided at points; which doesn\\'t make for a thorough watch if you are looking to feel like everyone is getting it handed to them. Absolutely enjoyable if you are looking to be frightened by the state of America. It can be worryingly too close to home and surely isn\\'t for the faint of heart.,It has been a long time since I laughed out loud so much at a comedy movie! Much better than the first one and very clever. The actress who played the daughter was brilliant too and a great addition to the storyline.,This is not only disgusting but extremely offensive! If you have any decency at all I don\\'t advise watching. For sure keep innocent eyes and ears of children away from this horrible so called movie.,If you can look past that there\\'s nothing new compared to the last 2.,No originality and too much fake scenes. Bad direction there!\\nAround the unsuspected people there are 2 or three moving cameras. Those are studio takes; made believe as \"hidden camera\". Very offending to the viewer\\'s IQ!\\nAlso; too many \"Kazakstanian\" dialogues; too many!\\nI love S. B. Cohen but that film was a Titanic (the shipwreck; not the movie)\\nLastly it\\'s obvious that Giuliani is fixing his shirt.,So sad that it takes a comic genius to highlight the ugly side of the US&A,Enjoyed the first Borat film but this was pitiful. Felt very staged; humour was base and tried to use unimaginative crass humour to drive the storyline; which in itself was pretty much non existent.Really struggled to watch to the end; with few laughs and nothing substantial that resembled any sort of meaningful social commentary on the current state of politics in the US. Contrived and lacking anything interesting bar a slightly creepy Rudy Guliiani - which seems to be the only selling point the media have latched on to (which is maybe a hint at how bad the rest of the content is for those bothered to watch to the end).For what it\\'s worth; I\\'m from the UK; left leaning politically and very much anti Trump and his lackeys; which maybe makes the missed opportunity to do something clever and insightful; the biggest disappointment.,I have never laughed so hard.Cohen went after them all: countries that see women as second hand citizens and who\\'s only purpose is to obey. He portrayed Melania as a \\'\\'lucky one\\'\\' for living in a gold cage rather than in a normal one. I think Giuliani was under the impression he is going to get lucky. Kind of reminded me of \\'\\'The Limo \\'\\' episode in Seinfeld where George was close to getting lucky to a nazi simpathiser. The Facebook touch was also brilliant as more and more people believe stories on their Facebook feed which could really be written by anyone who wants to have a laugh at the expense of gullible people. If you don\\'t allready have prime get it and watch this movie. Nobody portraits the tragic reality we live in better than Borat!,Comparing Borat to Borat 2 is like comparing Disney\\'s animated Aladdin to Aladdin 2.This is a political film that makes fun of Republicans and Kazakhstanis; and its targeted toward today\\'s college students.\\nSacha is riding the waves of where the money is; instead of doing anything original; like the first film.None of the big pranks are funny; but a couple of the less random; smaller jokes and gags; are.All Leftists will enjoy the film. Everyone else; will either not see it; or if they do; they will feel let down.,Impactful. Meaningful. Worthy. Dark. Comedy. Naked Truth. Thank you for your courage and boldness; Cinema - are few words that come to my mind after watching this movie.,The movie might be 7+ rating however 10 when one thinks of the odds of making such a movie and not getting - arrested; punched; catching covid; is an achievement. Including the dialogs where retakes are not possible.Not sure timing of Borats entrance in hotel bedroom was deliberate or just coincidence that users were left to decide whether (avoiding taking names) was tucking in shirt or was going to beyond that.And it\\'s not just for comedy; it\\'s made for getting the message out on what\\'s wrong with ~30-40% of America that got such an administration and it\\'s supporting cronies elected.,Just when we thought satire was lost; here\\'s borat.,I did not understand what people loved about the first movie because that type of humour is not my thing. The 2nd movie is pure genius. I laughed out loud throughout; but the laughs are not what makes this movie great. Borat 2 is a satirical look down the rabbit of current day America. We need more movies that point out the absurdity of current events.,When reality as become a parody; laughing at it\\'s buffoons is mandatory. If you didn\\'t like the movie; the joke was probably on you.,Typical mainstream shill movie. I\\'d get the same effect if I watched CNN for 2 hours. Skip this one and watch the original.,The last Borat was hilarious; this one felt like another Republican hit job from Hollywood.,If you weren\\'t a fan of the original Borat film; then this probably won\\'t be a hit with you. If however; you were laughing at Cohen\\'s antics in the original film; then you will know what to expect and will probably love it.Maria Bakalova was a co-star more than a supporting actress - likely down to Borat\\'s notoriety from the original film - and the script relied heavily on her being convincing in her interactions with the American public. She pulled it off well.The standout moment featured Rudy Giuliani. Will be interesting to see how much damage that does to him...,As expected from part 1 I got lot more fun but please don\\'t watch with your family,All the conservative yanks will be furious and leaving bad reviews to this movie; but that\\'s just them crying out loud because they don\\'t like to be criticized nor to be exposed on how their society and culture are imploding. But all those bad reviews mean that this movie it\\'s a political satire masterpiece!This movie trashes very hard the behaviour and stupidity of American rednecks and their political leaders.God Bless Sacha Baron Cohen!,WHAT A GEM !!! Not until Borat #1 could I have found any value for SBC; since then he brought an authentic Comic Genius for those who dare.\\nI would have predicted \"One and Done\" after the 1st Bora; as\\nit seemed INCONCIEVABLE that there could ever be another made....BUT Gullible was I; this one is a TRUE MASTERPIECE!!!\\nAside from the expected inappropriate yet laughable sacrilegious antics; anti-Semitism; racism; misogynistic themes; etc... again were the scenes where \"simple American country folk\" appear to be portrayed as if ignorant to the decade; in which some actually are; and they ain\\'t acting.\\nBUT this time even the True Blue N.Y.C.\\'s Ex-Mayor; the actual Personal Attorney to the POTUS himself; RUDY G. was truly CLUELESS to the semi-private situation he was in as he \"FIDDLED ABOUT\"; not knowing just how not-private it really was.\\nOk; so he\\'s just another well-known senile and demented \"Dirty Old Man\" politician; but were \"his people\" not aware enough to protect him from himself? All he had to do was admit he had a great time participating in Borat 2 and acting along it for fun\"; but he is not even that wise.WELCOME & BRAVO to Maria Bakalova; as she partnered up perfectly with SBC to double the comedic delivery of a much-needed \"roll with the times\" escape from the overflowing Year of DRAMA that 2020 has been; and still with a POTUS election yet to go.,As a big fan of the original Borat film; I was obviously excited when the sequel was announced. However; I was fully aware of the stigma regarding sequels; and I tapered my expectations. Much to my surprise; I found the 2nd installment to be very enjoyable. Just like the original; The Subsequent Moviefilm has a large handful of shocking and laugh-out-loud moments. Borat 2 also has many somewhat amusing jokes; and several gags that aren\\'t that funny; but this is to be expected from nearly any comedy these days. My only real criticism of the sequel is that it feels very relevant to the current events of 2020; so it may not be nearly as funny in five years or so. All in all; Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is a worthy sequel of the original.,Although this film is not as funny or shocking as the first Borat film; it is still thoroughly entertaining; shocking and full of the excruciating scenes one would expect from Borat. Sacha\\'s writing and delivery are superb. I loved the addition of his daughter; played brilliantly by Maria B; although there was an element of poignancy with her character.,This guy has the balls to pull of things like nobody else can\\nBorat makes you uncomfortable so that yu can understand what it really means\\nFreaking hilariously,It was fine; but seeing all the great reviews make me want to review it less. What are you seeing that I\\'m not? I wish I could elaborate more; all I can say is that it\\'s what I expected. A super commercialized version of borat.,Borat 2 is as amazing as the first one and touches on some of America\\'s political problems. Sacha Baron gives an amazing performance along with his \"daughter\" that is Golden Globe or even Oscar worthy. And thinking that he did it within a pandemic; pranking some of America\\'s highest political figures without them knowing that they were being filmed for a movie; makes it much more fun.\\nGive this film a watch and you won\\'t be disappointed. It\\'s NIICE.\\nHIGH FIVE.,Sacha does it again. I started the movie thinking this is going to be so silly stupid. It\\'s actually really creative and had me crying laughing more than once.,This movie is very dumb and anopropriate. Sasha himself is very ignorant person who makes fun of other cultures. I guess for most people it will be a bug shock but Kazakhstan where the main character is from is a real beautiful country. The way borat exposes it is very offensive. If you like jokes about pubes and period I guess this is a movie for you.,I liked it but 1st is still close to heart. But i would love to see more.,It\\'s been a while since I laughed out loud to some comedy. Really rib tickling stuff. A must watch if you like funny movies. But if find it offensive you have to take it lightly to enjoy it.,I really loved it but all tho I still prefer there first movie,Really looked forward to watching this; wish I hadn\\'t bothered. Not funny in the slightest. Awful.,As a non-american user;I really liked the movie .\\nIn its politically incorrect way of humor; Borat manages to destroy every certainty of every American and at the same time show the corrupt sides of the most glorious nation in the world.\\nThe fact that the movie was shot during the election campaign made me even more happy.\\nA movie that unfortunately a lot of people will hate; thanks to its nature; but that many will understand over the time.,Don\\'t listen to all the 1/10 reviews. This movie is the opposite of being \"anti-woman\"; it seems a lot of people are missing the fact that you\\'re not supposed to agree with Borat; but laugh at how the people of a supposedly more civilized country react to him.\\nI honestly it holds up decently compared to the first one; sure it has a lot more scripted scene and the storyline is more coherent; but the fact that SBC can still get those kind of reactions out of people years after he reached worldwide fame is honestly jawdropping.\\nHuge shoutout to Maria Bakalova; she was absolutely hilarious as Borat\\'s daughter.,Sadly this is time I won\\'t get back in my life. I went into watching this hoping for at least a few laughs but I couldn\\'t muster even one. It felt very one-sided in who he\\'s targeting (which is likely the point). After viewing this I likely won\\'t be watching another Sasha Baron Cohen film.,Borat - the character which will be remembered all the time and perhaps would have been thought over for why they did not make more out of it! This one really is a good sequel to its decade long release. Its vulgar and disgusting but yet very entertaining!\\nWanna have more of this!,Brilliant haven\\'t seen a movie like this in a while\\nHad me laughing like crazy\\nA must watch with family\\nIf u have a sense of humour you\\'ll love this\\nIt\\'s better to laugh then wine about things\\nEnjoy life,Was a big fan of Ali-G but after that Sasha has gone down hill. I watched with high hopes but honestly didn\\'t laugh once from beginning to end. This movie is nothing more than a desperate attempt to defeat Trump with last minute votes and only uses mainstream media lies. It is very obvious to anyone with have a brain. But I\\'m sure liberals had a good laugh they have much lower standards and we\\'re probably high while watching.,A lot of offended republicans rated the movie with 1/10 still the movie made it to 7.2/10. I hope this is a forecast of the coming election.,If you rated this movie less than five stars then you either didn\\'t watch it or skipped straight to the Giuliani part.,A great and very funny/clever/ audacious follow -up to his previous Borat masterpieces. Poor old dumb the dumber Giuliani caught unaware and unprepared,This demographic for this film seems to be 12-year-old boys. I did not find it to be in the least bit funny.Much of this film is extremely insulting towards women: women in cages; women menstruating; women\\'s breasts; women being sold as property; etc. I got so fed up with all this; I didn\\'t finish the film.The misogynism was bad enough. But adding insult to injury; the insults were not even funny. They just made me cringe.My favorite film genre is satire. But to be effective; satire has to be subtle: Broad enough to let viewers feel good about being in on the joke; but not so broad the film seems to be endorsing the very things it is supposedly lampooning. Sacha Cohen badly overstepped.,Don\\'t waste your time with this lowbrow mindless garbage.\\n.,Yes; 35 minutes; that\\'s when I stopped watching. I tried; I really tried because I believe to make an educated comment; one must go through the process.However I could not go through with it. it\\'s pathetically idiotic; not funny; not even shocking; not really offensive.... it... it... it\\'s just ... I have no words.Simply put; a complete waste of time and bandwidth.,About 3 minutes worth watching. 1.5hrs of wasted time.,I really enjoyed this film; clever; hilarious and surprisingly heartwarming. If you liked the first movie you will certainly like the second.,Superb ; hilarious ; provocative ; a must see for all who wants Borat\\'s assessment of the current political climate,Borat and Maria; are amazing actors do not feel shame like the rest of us; which allows him to do some legendary hilarious and cringeworthy performances; while giving an important message at the same time.,I went in expecting a few laughs; and I got much more. Having read some reviews that\\'ve been posted; I thought I\\'d weigh in my opinion.Sure the movie had some obvious staged scenes; but there were a lot of genuine reactions by innocent bystanders. For example; the dance scene at the ball was genuine; Michael Pence; the scene with Trump\\'s lawyer; as well as the song at the rally.Some say the ending was rushed; but in my opinion; the ending tied the movie\\'s plot VERY NICEly together. I had a hard time believing that Khazakhstan\\'s president would send Borat on a mission as ridiculous as delivering a gift to Trump\\'s second in line; just to get in the \"big boys club\".\\nSo; for me; the ending made perfect sense.I\\'m entitled to my views; and everyone else to their own :),Not as sharp and fresh as the original; but \\'Borat Subsequent Moviefilm\\' is still sharp and very enjoyable nonetheless. It is a hilarious and brilliantly astute commentary on current events and the social and political landscape of America. Sacha Baron Cohen is still hilarious while Maria Bakalova steals the show.,It has been a very difficult year; but this film is what we needed. I never expected this to be as funny as the first film.\\nSacha Baron Cohen embodies Borat & he is great at eliciting scripted/genuine ignorance from the public. However; the performance from Maria Bakalova as his daughter Tutar that brings heart to this film. It is an enjoyable film & I would recommend this.,I loved this movie! I am a Trump fan but I do have a sense of humor & I gave this a 10! I\\'ve been watching scary movies for the last 2 weeks so it was a change to watch a comedy. I watched by myself and literally laughed OUT LOUD at least every 5-10 minutes!. I love Sacha Baron Cohen and Maria Bakalova was excellent in her role. They had me in tears I was laughing so hard. I needed a great comedy to watch and it\\'s hard to find one that keeps my attention; I will be watching again for a nonstop LOLfest! Thank you for making this for us especially at a time where we could all use cracking up in a good way!,Disregard the negative reviews. They are all from Republicans or uptight prudes (also Republicans). There is nothing in the trailer or Cohen\\'s history that leads you to believe that this is a wholesome family film. It is exactly what we come to expect from Cohen\\'s brilliant docu-comedies; a sophomoric and hilarious satire on the many flaws of American society and he has a LOT of material to work with.,For almost 2 hours I forgot it was 2020 and the world felt like a better place. This movie was so entertaining!!,Even better than the first movie; and extremely relevant to current events. Great acting; and lots of original humour.Without a doubt; anyone who gives this a bad rating (or downvotes this comment) was simply offended at how stupid it made them; or the people like them look. Bring in the cringey trump supporters who can\\'t take a joke.SBC has always obviously been left leaning; and if that offends you; there\\'s a good chance you won\\'t like this film.,His follow-up is insanity... how does he get away with it!!!🤣🤣. Phenomenal comedy!,From a \"faith-based\" Women\\'s Clinic to Georgia debutante ball; Borat goes where few journalists dare and exposes our not so hidden hypocrisy in the process. I laughed. I cringed. I saw Rudy Guliani expose himself for the creep he is.\\nThank you; Sacha Baron Cohen. By the way; is it true that Melania named her son after you?,Sasha is giving us a few laughs and some serious warnings if you can see beneath the humor. This movie should be seen by everyone in the world and a wake up call to people.\\nSasha is wide awake in a world full of sleeping sheep. This movie is full of TRUTH. But the Truth can be scary if you know where the world is heading.\\nLook below the fake comedic facade for the scary truth.,Borat and his daughter are hilarious. Satire for sure. Love the fat suit and the disguise,What worked:Sacha Baron Cohen is at it again in his subsequent moviefilm. Cohen; playing Kazakhstan journalist Borat must travel back to America and offer a gift to President Trump to make up for embarrassing Kazakhstan in the first Borat movie.There were a lot of hilarious scenes from Borat visiting a religious doctor\\'s office asking the doctor to take out his daughter\\'s \\'baby\\'; to Borat bursting into CPAC and the Rudy Giuliani scene.If you want a good laugh; I can\\'t think of anything better right now.,I wasn\\'t a Borat fan; but the second part is better than the first part! Politicians in America should learn something from this movie!\\nI give 10 stars to the movie!,... and for all the right reasons. Some genuinely laugh out loud moments leave you under no illusion just how talented Sacha Baron Cohen is as he ridicules some particularly odious and obnoxious characters; cultures; traditions and beliefs. With outstanding support from Maria Bakalova; you might be surprised how immune you\\'ve become to fascism in the land of the free but at least you\\'ll do it with tears streaming down the side of your face and; quite possibly; a blub or two as the satire and mockery is gradually absorbed and starts to sink in.,I really liked this film; I laughed non stop all the way through. I love the first movie and would say this is as funny if not funnier. Definitely something to watch if you just want to have a good laugh; and who doesn\\'t need that after the year we\\'ve had so far. 10 out of 10 in my books 👍🏼,Borat does what he does the best that is messing with the culture of extreme black and white. The upside of this movie over the previous one is it\\'s story which follows proper order in the midst of all the commotions. Borat\\'s daughter adds additional entertaining performance to Sacha Baron incredible comic relief. Nothing could be better to relieve stress than Borat in covid 19 era...lol,I tried to like it; but SBC hit a wall a long time ago.,Borat 2 was laugh out loud funny at times; but certainly not enough to warrant an 8/10. The story actually had some coherence rather than feeling like a prank show and even had some solid emotion; but that still can\\'t account for its 8/10 status. What drove it up for me was how expertly executed these secret filmings must have been. Sure everyone has to sign a release to show their face in the film afterwards; but to corner some people to the point that they want/need to is mind boggling. As far as films that have a number one goal of shoving a political message in my face; this has to be my favorite.,The sequel to Borat - Borat Subsequent Moviefilm - is extremely clever; and definitely funny at times. This film once again proves that Sacha Baron Cohen is one of the most successful comedians who can expose the most misguided (or utterly repugnant) corners of America. Yes; this is a comedy; yes it is extreme and vulgar at times; but there are so many truths in this film. Definitely makes one step back and think about what parts of America are like. RUDY GIULIANI- I think got a little of what he deserves; given that he is a snake and a repulsive old man.,It\\'s uncomfortable; laughable; maddening and it is heartbreaking.Borat returns 14 years after exposing the dark underbelly of our country only to discover that it\\'s no longer hidden beneath the surface. This film exposes a level of racism; bigotry and stupidity that have become commonplace.But however disturbing (and it really is incredibly sickening) much of the film is to watch; Borat (Sasha Baron Cohen) and Tutor (Maria Bakalova) manage to create a thread of hope throughout the film.This was unlike the first Borat. But in 2020 it had to be. Watch this.,In these awful times; just what we needed. Genius; Sasha.,Consistent laughs; great movie. A master of making people say stupid things,While the film was a lil short and rushed; it was still a good delivery despite the circumstances that they had making it. Brilliantly trolling and making the petals cry.,The funniest actor with the best movie in the whole world ; Sacha Baron Cohen :),It\\'s a really funny movie; everything is just exceptionally good.,This will definitely trigger those who call others \"snowflakes\" because they are thin skinned and don\\'t understand irony.,Thank you sacha for showing the bigotry and the nice people as well of this country; this was a great movie and if you can\\'t watch this with an open mind you are missing out; keep doing what you do man. Big up,This is so poor compared to the first one! A sour lefty pushing his agenda against Trump. Should have stuck to Ali G; and retired. Let your wife- who has talent earn the money!!,Guy 1: hes so funny looking\\nguy 2: *hated thus moodie*,I am a long time fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; and eagerly anticipated a sequel to one of the funniest films ever made; Borat. Unfortunately; this is probably his worst work yet; and along with his comic genius; he has produced a few clangers. This is the worst yet.Unfortunately; almost everything is painfully staged; and the few candid moments; would have been left on the cutting room floor; had there been anything else to string the film together.\\nNewcomer Maria Bakalova does her best; and manages to drive the very few and far between candid and humorous moments in the film.This sequel should not have been made.,Unfortunately it\\'s hard for SBC to be Borat in public; as it\\'s evident he is recognised everywhere; this is made clear very early on.\\nSBC playing Borat playing someone else; is a level of genius; however doesn\\'t enable the raw outrageous antics of Borat Sagdiyev.\\nA lot of effort was put into this; it\\'s clear; and the same disruptive pranks are followed throughout.,Its most of what you would expect. Hilarious; uncomfortable; and mostly shocking. If im being honest it reminds me more of \"Who Is America\" but I was a big fan. If you like seeing the real side of people; then I\\'d definitely check this out. Even if you don\\'t like what you see.,Was happy when I found out that a new Borat movie was released.Unfortunately this is very far from comedy. Didn\\'t laugh even once. All I see is leftist political activism. Sasha Cohen has unfortunately disappointed with this one.This was more like Who is America part 2.,This movie is a gut punch to the fringe (or now mainstream?) right-wing. It is Borat\\'s fearless; vulgar take down of American ignorance. Some fans are disappointed that the movie is too overtly political; with targets like QANON and MAGA; how can Cohen resist? The most sympathetic; endearing characters in the film are the real-life Black and Jewish women who try to save the misguided Borat and his show-stealing \"daughter.\" This is a movie that shocks the system; but that is why it is precisely right for the time. WARNING: If you support the idea that Democrats drink baby blood; this might not be the movie for you.,It\\'s fascinating to me how Sacha Baron Cohen writes & acts in such mockumentaries than when he is in a drama. The sheer range of this man is absolutely amazing. \"Borat\" took everybody by surprise for its narrative and \"Subsequent MovieFilm\" raises the bar and ends on a warm; touching note. It is hilarious from the get-go; all the punches land & obviously SBC doesn\\'t pull his punches back. Some scenes are uncomfortable yet hilarious. Loved Maria Bakalova! Her chemistry with SBC is fabulous. The social commentary was a big addition to the political conversation. Loved everything about the movie and I\\'m sure I can watch it multiple times!,It\\'s often hard for a sequel to live up to the original; but this came pretty darn close. The daughter was a very smart twist that differentiated it from the original. Also considering that it was filmed during COVID; I\\'m very pleased with the outcome.,The only low scores will be from upset redneck and Mcdonald Trump fans. They are shown up for the gullible idiots they are by Sacha and how he brings covid into the story as it happened live and surely altered the ending he had oringally planned is just pure genius.The first was funnier; this one is more important.,Lenny Bruce pushed the limits in his day by cursing; SBC does it by splashing lewd and disgusting imagery into your face. This is not comedy. It is offensive no matter what your politics.,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is great! It manages to recreate the bizarre tone and vibrancy of the first film and updates the story to feel very 2020 with some excellent satire; social commentary and several standout hilarious segments. Sacha Baron Cohen is still not afraid to offend you and remains excellent at doing so. Maria Bakalova is an instant comedy star as his daughter Tutar (truly a new icon of the genre). I will never forget the fertility dance; as long as I live. 🤣 There\\'s also a bit of unexpected character depth and pathos which I didn\\'t expect from this movie. This unlikely father-daughter story just works. 👏,Loved it; Borat is back -- and how !! More irreverent and politically incorrect than ever. I haven\\'t laughed this hard in a while. Thank you S.B.Cohen for giving us something to laugh our heads off; in this time of gloom.,Just what we need in these dark times; something to lighten the mood with some belly laughs. The actress that plays his daughter is amazing; as it the guy at the fax shop. As always; shines a light on the farce that is america and its politics at the moment. Let\\'s hope Borat is the saviour that can sort things out.,The phrase; \"Give em enough rope to hang themselves\"; was never more true! At times hilarious; at times disturbing; never boring. SBC does a good job of showing some people who were genuinely kind and compassionate as well; which restores a certain degree of faith in the US of A. Even; at times; some of those who he is lampooning are portrayed with a degree of humanity; not just caricatures. They are shown as misinformed; yet caring and hard-working. The actions of Rudy G; the gold-digger; and others; however; speak for themselves. TBH; If you have more than one Trump sign in your yard and need your daily Sean Hannity fix; you will probably hate it.,Yes; it\\'s heavily political. Yes; some scenes will shock you. But considering we\\'re days away from what may be the most important election of our lives; I believe this is a great tool to remind us of some of the horrible things going on of which we have become desensitized. Watch it asap!,I had a great time watching this. I would definitely recommend this to you.,This movie is a work of art in a politically tenseful time. It can potentially trigger both Democrats and Republicans . Expected for 2 sensitive groups that only see each other as red and blue.The movie itself flows really good. The skits are hard to tell if real or not . But after reading more info on the actors ; there\\'s no way you could of wrote that type of material . It flowed too natural out of those people\\'s mouth\\'s for not being actors . A lot of organic humors momentsVery good movie. Not as offensive as the first one but still good enough to stand on it\\'s own. I hope he makes tons of cash off it .,Brilliant funny heart warming current virus times .,This movie has nothing to do with the first film; it\\'s just election year propaganda.,Very sad about seeing a movie made just for politics reasons. And it was no funny at all.,The worst film; if that\\'s what you can call it; I\\'ve ever seen. Didn\\'t laugh once and was clearly paid for by Amazon to have a poke at Trump supporters and Trump before the election.\\nAnother example of how low the Elite will stop to try and fool the public. How wrong they wereSasha should be ashamed for this political stunt for money,Not as good as first. Still decent albeit nauseating at times.,This is definitely in line with the spirit of the first movie but it does give off a vibe of \"recycled material\". There are definitely some funny moments but some of them felt very scripted; after looking into it a bit more; it\\'s been confirmed some of them were staged (not all of them though) and that is also taking away some of the charm. Still a pretty funny comedy overall if like me you like this type of humor.,I was a big fan of the first Borat movie but this one is just embarrassing. Tries too hard to slag republicans and fails huge. Don\\'t bother wasting an hour and a half.,So my favourite character of all time; as with all the rest on this sick times; was brought back to life simply to destroy Trump and make him look bad. Borat too; had to become political. You can\\'t make this s**t up. Needless to Stay; not a single political scene is funny. Only when borat is being the old borat; free of \"wokeness\"; makes you laugh. I\\'m such a huge huge fan of borat...I can\\'t believe Sasha Baron Cohen did this to us. I mean...really Unforgivable. The guy is completly blind in his hate for Trump.Shame on you Sasha!Boy am i disappointed...,Pushes the boundaries and sometimes leaps over the line. But after the initial gut reaction I found myself in stitches. Haven\\'t laughed that hard in a while.Sends a message; tells a story; and somehow accomplishes both merged into one. The plot line makes you ask what could be possible and what is too absurd to be believable only to realize that every single event is exists.,Really dumb; their bad acting and fake gibberish language was not only lazy but annoying to my ears. Also it\\'s ironic he shows the video of Trump calling women hot; when I haven\\'t met a single straight man (even liberals and Hillary supporters) resist calling a woman hot or talking about women with desire. It\\'s human nature and any woman who thinks her boyfriend hasn\\'t objectified women is not only naive but probably a mentally impaired feminist.,What a dissapointment! You can only stretch a joke to a certain degree and then it becomes unbearable. This is just a rehash of old film but more daft and ridiculous. Unwatchable and totally avoidable. Watch the first film again instead; and it will be more enjoyable than this junk.,Cohen is amazing. He knows exactly how to build enough intrigue with these marks. He capitalises on their curiosity ultimately leading to their being the butt of the joke. And who can feel sorry for them When you\\'re laughing your behind off?The ending will make you smile.,Enjoyed every bit of it. Well written and nicely put together. SB cohen does it again!!,I loved the first one; and in generally SBH works. This one is too staged; not that funny. Disappointing.,There area few good laughs in this; the best being a dance. If you don\\'t like rednecks and southerners much; you will like this. Though I think they have been unfairly treated here; cherry picked you could say.Hard to tell who was real and who was acting in some cases.\\nThe actor playing his daughter did a good job.,9/10 - hysterical; timely; and quite revealing sequel to the 2006 original will certainly be one to look back on in a few years,Outstanding from start to finish; Maria Bakalova deserves an award; that girl has got crazy talent. Borot hasn\\'t missed a beat. When Americans do unbelievably stupid thing he\\'s there to just shine a mirror at them. Excellent work.,I think the humor of this film is not for everyone; but I think this is more than a comedy. Borat makes us see the reality of things thanks to the humor that he manages. Borat\\'s only \"bad\" is that at times it feels slow for the hour and a half that lasts. But I think Sacha Baron Cohen does a great job handling this mod.,I can\\'t even remember the last time I laughed so hard and as much as last night watching this one. SBC for the win!,I am baffled. Is the point of this movie franchise to embarrass people? Like a less funny or clever version of \"Nathan for You\"? It\\'s incredibly awkward and I found myself cringing the entire time. There is a great way to do awkward humor and this just made me feel bad for the people who were forced to interact with this incredibly annoying and ridiculous character. 2 stars because of production value,This was a really smart movie with many real hidden camera scenes. Very political; very liberal and very true.,Taking Borat to the now openly broken America 14 years later; Cohen skewers one piggish facet of American culture after another - ultimately cutting at some of Trumps top cronies. Pure genius meets comedic balls of steel.Watch.,I laughed the entire time. Not sure how he gets away with these stunts especially this time but this one hits home in a huge way. He manages to poke fun at everything that is wrong with America today and it was just brilliant. Loved it; 10/10!,Just bizarre.\\nCould be very funny but its just made of the bad parts.\\nThe daughter is just terrible.Democrat hollywood.,This movie seems so forced and it is not remotely clever or funny at all. It\\'s too bad some people have no respect for themselves or the things they create because in my opinion he is just raping the character to make a little more money.,All of us gathered around the TV were so psyched; so thrilled. Finally another Borat. We all agreed that expecting anything like the first one was probably unwise; but we all thought we would be astonished; yet again. Maybe in another way; maybe less this time; but still...When the movie ended there was a big silence. And then some \"humms\". We had all tried so hard; during the movie; to laugh. We were all trying so hard now to find something fun to talk about and laugh together about. Nothing. Just \"humm\".Complete and utter disappointment. Nothing fun; just political and .. dumb.,Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is easily the funniest movie of 2020 and perhaps one of the funniest of all time. A product of its\\' time; the film takes what are now familiar themes of Sasha Baron Cohen and incorporates them into Borat\\'s familiar idiom. He takes you on long journey that ends in the present day with stops along the way to embarrass people left and right. He shows how strange our country has become and yet; it\\'s a familiar kind of strange. The plot is very clever. How he pulled such an amazing series of events together is baffling. They must have had to constantly adapt to new circumstances until they got the results that made the most sense. Oh; and it\\'s easily the funniest movie I\\'ve seen in many years. Maybe since the first Borat. I recommend it for the laughs even if you don\\'t agree with the sentiments. It\\'s that funny ...,Not good as the first movie; but i think thats normal. Many cringe and funny moments. i enjoyed it a lot,So it\\'s a bit of a culture mish-mash and that\\'s what makes it fun. I liked most of the jokes; it started off a little slow but got better; but overall it was fun the whole way though. My initial feelings...I was glad to have seen it; and I would probably watch it again. I would not say this is a family friendly movie; I don\\'t think a younger audience will really get a lot of the jokes; this is definitely meant for those who are part of the political environment which has been such a hot topic lately; and it does a very good job of capturing most of it. I did like the ending a lot; it has a bit of a twist I was not expecting at all which I thought was very impressive for such a film.,I wish good luck to Maria and hopefully she gets involved in many other movies. We need new faces and talent especially from eastern europe; because there is not many at the moment.,The original is still one of the funniest movies of the last 15 years. This one is different; more of a movie than a documentary. Borat is; still that loveable but non pc buffoon. The story between father and daughter is cringy but also heartwarming. Maria Buklova is a defo star in the making. Good but not great like the first.,Retread of same jokes from first movie. What is original isn\\'t funny.....at...all.Cohen appears to have jumped the shark.,Smh If there were 0 i would have gave it 0/0 this movie was so bad,Watch Sasha Baron in the Spy and you will wonder how that amazing actor produces such pure trash comedy like these movies. Sasha\\'s Boring\\'s comedy is not only not funny but is just pushing the media agenda on fake scandals which is already over played. Hope he makes another series like the spy before he gets hit by a bus. Not sure which I will enjoy more.,The movie reminds me of a Three Stooges episode brought forward in time and with an R rated theme. The movie rambles around in an attempt to expose social and moral hypocrisy and does so in a predictable manor. It would be a total waste of time but for the crescendo of \"exposing\" a leading political hypocrite; Rudy Giuliani. Rudy becomes the \"star\" of the movie because he is the only one who doesn\\'t understand that he is the principal \"Stooge\". Seeing him caught with his \"hand in the cookie jar\" provides the grand laugh of 2020.,This movie has more laugh out loud moments than 95% of all comedies in 2020.\\nWhether you\\'re right wing or left wing or whatever the hell; this is just funny. No it\\'s not the exact same as the first movie; but what were you expecting?,Humorous that Amazon; the massive tech empire under the recent attention by AOC and 3 for monopolistic business practices; threatened to be investigated and potentially broken apart; fans the left with more glory... feeding the youth with more anti American propaganda... attacks the right; which traditionally is more capitalistic and would favor Amazon. So you have a catch 22 here... attack the dog that feeds you to ultimately be destroyed by the left who you seem to love so dearly.As far as this \"film\"... borat returns; this time to go full force on one particular group of people in the US. What made the first film funny was that he just went after everyone.If ratings weren\\'t obvious enough guys... I don\\'t know what else will cause these loons to re-align. Go woke and go broke. However; the down votes come from the kids who think it\\'s cool still to rebel against society; wearing graphic tees; joggers and park ranger hats on Instagram. Or the others that paid 200g for degrees that ultimately mean nothing to society and expect everyone to pay for their mistakes.If I could rate this propaganda a 0 I would. And I\\'m not even the demographic attacked in this pathetic 1.5 hour waste of time. Not even gypsy tears can save this dump.,It\\'s not funny or clever. A narcissistic sociopath creating shock value moments. People who laugh at similar have moral and intellectual challenges that should be assessed for psychotherapy treatment. I feel sorry for his wife and children.,Just watch it...there will be butthurt people giving bad reviews; but the dark humor is just next level.,IM NOT VOTING FOR TRUMP ANYMORE BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE! THANKS BORAT,Sarcastically on point. Very well made movie during pandemic ; not as funny as borat 1 but serves its purpose with great humor.,The gags weren\\'t quite as outrageous as in the first film (which I consider a 10); and it was a bit slower-paced; and it felt more scripted; and once you\\'re familiar with the Borat process it loses some of its novelty. That being said; this movie is a solid comedy with plenty of chuckles and some great laugh-out-loud moments. If nothing else; it\\'s worth it just to watch a certain politician/lawyer be put in a very compromising situation toward the end of the movie. I recommend it.,I didn\\'t like the 1st Borat movie and only reason why I watch this one; is because my husband asked me to. I laughed though the whole film. My favorite personal favorites are the baby; the father and daughter dance; the bathroom scene at the convention; and the end with Rudy.Don\\'t know why people are hating on this. Honestly I expected this movie to really suck; because I really hated the first one. However I was really surprised; I laughed throughout the movie.Watch it!,In the scene where the girl is dancing with her period; you can see the blood on the floor disappear then re-appear in different shots. They likely filmed this scene in an empty room then cut it in to make it look like it was in front of an audience.This is the kind of misleading garbage that SBC has devolved to.The Giuliani scene had similar tricks and ended up being a huge letdown. He WAS clearly tucking his shirt back in; after the girl tugged it out when removing his mic.I also find it annoying that all the media outlets were reporting she was referred to being 15 years old through out the interview. Not once is \"15\" mentioned in the scene until after the bed shot when SBC bursts in and says she\\'s 15.Not a fan of the guy and it\\'s obvious what he\\'s thinking but it\\'s hardly some massive \"caught red handed\" moment they hyped it up to be.All in all SBC just looks like he\\'s doing a bad impersonation of Borat; and the whole joke of the film is supposed to be pointing out how crazy conservatives are. Which; by itself; is not funny.,For those who got mad over the movie; then they accomplished what they where aiming for.,It is funny and wild; but there is something missing. The first one was super funny because of the reactions of other people. This subsequent moviefilm has much less surprised or disgusted reactions. People are just so calm about what they see.,It is easy to see why people are offended by films such as these; however feel that is exactly the point. The content is meant to shock; its produced in a way that makes you question whether you\\'re a good or bad person for laughing. This is real satire. No individual in a position if power is safe from Sacha Baron Cohen; the man is a genius. Though weaker than the first film I still found myself laughing out loud at the majority of the film. Would fully recommend. Very nice!,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm like first part; was fairly amusing.The satirical idea for the film is simply brilliant. The character of Borat is same as first; brilliant.The movie starts slow but with time; movie becomes amazing and the ending was unexpected. It\\'s execution was better than the first one.There are no proper words to describe Cohen. His dedication and perfection in this role is nearly unheralded in my mind.Overall; I would recommend everyone to watch and enjoy it.,It\\'s obvious that this movie wouldn\\'t live up to the original. There\\'s not nearly as much public skits because of how well-known the Borat name is nowadays; and it was those skits that made the original so big in the first place. Knowing that; Cohen tries to make up for it by focusing on a few bigger scenarios involving people in power unknowingly starring in the movie.I personally had a blast watching the spectacle unfold with the Borat character along with how the story weaves in current events in hilarious ways. The movie also has a much harder political edge than the first movie; which will make it a hard sell for some. It\\'s still more than worth the watch. Sacha Baron Cohen is still great as Borat and Maria Bakalova puts in a solid performance as well!,I loved the first movie and im not gonna lie; this is as close as it gets in these modern times. Its hard to fool people like Sacha and yet he still succeeds in many hilarious ways. Borats daughter Tutar is alot of fun; I laughed way to many times and her acting is brilliant. SHE FOOLED RUDY FFS AND almost got away with it. So it became \"extra\" brilliant to not just laugh at Sacha; but to her aswell with hilarious punch lines and good executed comments togheter with her father.I can\\'t help it to feel bad for all the people in this movie tho. Im not from America so I can\\'t comment on their political status (more than I\\'ve read from the news in Sweden). But still I guess they got what they deserved. For me watching the movie from another country without any knowledge about America was a joyfull but frightening experience. Especially the scenes with Judith the jew. I heard that she passed away (may she rest in piece) and that her daughter actually sued Sacha for making the film and was demanding that they removed the scene with her from the movie. I understand that to 100% but still. Probably the most beautiful part of the movie that Judith actually accepted Borat for being a jerk; giving him a hug and saying the word \"hope\".I truly think this is a masterpiece in all ways. You can seperate the scenes from reality and still stay very close to the content of this film. What an absolute blast it was but I must admit; many of the scenes where very very very immature. Like the sequence at the prom/ball with all the daughter and fathers. I wish I could see the aftermath from that building but it skipped to the next part directly. It portayed America and the Donald Trump followers like complete idiots but still with balls of still managed to live among them and speak to them as they respected Borat.GREAT ACTING - VERY VERY FUNNY - SACHA EXPOSED EVIL TO THE TRUTH - MADE AMERICA LOOK STUPID AGAIN*CHENGUI Sacha; I sincerelly hope that I will meet you someday.^thank you???,Go woke; go broke. A piece of unfunny and scatological cliches; lazy and lame political propaganda. Shame on you Amazon.,Remember when Borat made fun of everyone?\\nThere was a few laughable moments; but was not at all what I was hoping for.\\nWas expecting a more unbiased comedy poking at everyone.\\nJust another example of one sided film making; heavily disappointed.,Got to hand it to Sacha Baron Cohen; this is a remarkable feat. Okay; so in a few places there\\'s some staging but a lot of it is clearly filmed straight; fooling people into revealing some jaw-dropping stances.It\\'s cringe-making in many places at an almost unwatchable level but only because it\\'s so funny.What makes me award this 10 stars is that it\\'s very brave to have made this in 2020 in the run-up to the elections and in the midst of the coronavirus outbreak. A number of the pranks put Sacha\\'s life on the line.My only reservation is the moment in the synagogue but; wow; those ladies came out of it beautifully.Full marks to Maria Bakolova who plays the daughter brilliantly.,Sacha Baron Cohen back doing what he does best!\\nThis guy is in a league of he\\'s own. While a lot more of this Sequel is scripted; due to Borats high profile; these scenes are more for plot development and build up to the real scenes with the aim of people exposing themselves. For me; the three standout scenes that showcase this were; the abortion clinic; the final interview; and the ball. The daughters reaction to her father offering a large sum of money in exchange for Borat\\'s daughter was priceless; and the fact it was so genuine made it 10x funnier.\\nThe way the film ties in with current events but is also not constantly about covid is done extremely well and creates a great story line.\\nIn my opinion this film is just as hillairous as the original; but just at a less frequently; but is made up for with the better plot and conclusion.A special mention to the supporting actress who seems relatively unknown; but gave an exceptional performance. I definitely expect to be seeing more of her in future films. And of course Sacha the GOAT never disappoints!,Even better than the previous movie!!!!\\nSimply wonderful!,I compare the first one to Jackass. A bunch of cringeworthy segments; but this one had a plot tied into the cringeworthy segments. Maria Bakalova has balls of steel to keep up with the master Sasha Baron Cohen. She was more than delightful and mega comedy chops. The storyline which I didn\\'t put much thought into at first turned out to tie it all together in a great way. Worth the time and I will watch it again tomorrow.,Thank you so much for the greatness; both of you. Yugoslavian from cold preBrexit England admire your work; don\\'t settle down guys! Romani!,Excellent; not quite as funny as the first; but a better balance of cringe factor; first is still so hard to watch without muting the volume every now and then. Super relevant. Gonna be a few more lawsuits I think 😂,Would\\'ve given 7 stars but have to balance overall rating damage from people giving 1 star.,The most disturbing movie I have ever seen; to picture women to be treated like cows in a neglected barn in some countries.\\nThis is not discussing a case; because there is no such case even in some conservative countries towards women rights; there is no example like what the movie pictures with all of that disturbing exaggeration.\\nThose disturbing scenes I saw were covering comedy with sadness.\\nThis one is sad to be even evaluated.,This is a very entertaining and enlightening movie; sad but unsurprising views from right wing nuts,If this is the way ; they think ; they are going to beat Trump ; they are so wrong ! RUBISH won\\'t make it .,Absolute trash and not funny just like the first one. I don\\'t understand how or why anybody finds this funny. Do yourself a favor and skip it.,Tired jokes and the shock value has waned somewhat.Basically; it\\'s a political agenda movie. I think this is another tired excuse to play an increasingly overplayed game.Watch it if you\\'re a die hard Borat fan; it does have a few decent laughs. The cringe factor is based more on the lecture messaging; than the gags.Cohen is a great comedy actor and I\\'m sure there is better to come from him soon...,I am a big fan of Sacha and I think he is on the right side of history but this movie is lazy compared to the genius of the original. The jokes aren\\'t funny. The fake interviews aren\\'t shocking. Maybe it\\'s just that nothing is new under the sun in the age of social media - or maybe it\\'s just because the film is flat; lazy; and stupid. The daughter character is a disaster. The stuff dealing with the Republicans is worth watching however.,Without Borat\\'s daughter in this film I believe that it would\\'ve failed. She was fantastic and she made the movie her own! She was absolutely amazing!!!,Sasha is a genius; so so funny!\\nActress playing Borats daughter is brilliant!!!,Jagshemash! This mockumentary once again centers around Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev; a naïve misogynistic; racist; anti-Semitic stranger to American culture (Sacha Baron Cohen). While not as controversial shocking nor funny as the original. This Amazon Studios Video on Demand sequel directed by Jason Woliner deserved a high five for having more heart than the 2006 flick. While focusing on Borat\\'s relationship with his daughter Tutar (Maria Bakalova) on her arranged marriage to a top US politician can get annoying at times especially with the actress use of a heavy Bulgarian accent loud over nagging voice. I found the chemistry between them generally moving. Good acting. Both individuals do grow more likeable as the film goes on and into better people. It\\'s so unlike the first movie where the individuals mostly stay the same. Nevertheless; I didn\\'t like what the filmmakers did with original supporting characters like Azamat (Ken Davitian) & Luenell (Luenell Campbell). I get that the performers had pay disputes; but their characters should be written off the film a little better than what we got. Still the sequel does a good job acknowledges its predecessor\\'s success as well as the gap between movies; by explaining in universe that the first film made Kazakhstan into a laughing stock in the national stage. Thus; the government punish Borat for over a decade until he was given another chance with this sequel. Nevertheless; the guerrilla prank style filmmaking kinda has wine down since 2006; as the character\\'s image has become way too popular. Cohen even had to retired Borat at one time due to being unable to fool unaware real people to gain access to their genuine\\' s reactions toward solecism for laughs. In order to make the movie work; Sacha had to put Borat under heavy makeup and new disguises or give comedic trolling the crowd scenarios to Tutar. Because of that; there is very few scenes of Borat dress in his traditional suit and acting like himself; which is a shame. To add onto that; the people that he does interacted with; seem more in with the joke than the other movie. I\\'m not saying that they were paid performers; but I doubt that conspiracy theorists Jerry Holleman and Jim Russell would allow a man with a filmmaking crew to stay with them for five whole days without noticing something odd during a pandemic. Bits like them going to find Tutar at a rally seem heavily rehearsed. The same can be said with Jeanise Jones who drives her to the clinic and gives a bizarre; but inspiriting semi long speech to Borat\\'s daughter about womanhood. It\\'s really hard to believe that these people didn\\'t know that it was a work. The only confirm person that I can tell that was in with the joke was Holocaust survivor Judith Dim Evans. Her story was so charming that Cohen broke character. Sadly; the film\\'s creators still got sued for fraud when her heirs brought the lawsuit alleging that Judith did not consent to the commercial use of her likeness despite otherwise. Surprisingly unlike the first movie that result in many legal actions by participants ranging from individuals to whole cities. This one had little. Still; as of this writing; it is too early to tell. After all politicians like Rudy Giuliani might sued over allegations of impropriety. The actress did kinda led him on. Regardless the country of Kazakhstan will probably continue to hate their backwater racism portrayal in these films. Some Kazakhstanis really wanted this film to be canceled. I doubt that they would be happy with the twist ending involving the coronavirus. Still it makes me wonder what was the original climax if the pandemic never did hit during the production of this movie. I can see it being much more grandeur. COVID-19 really did good a number on the flick as the banning of large gatherings meant less events for Borat to crash into. While Cohen was indeed lucky to gain access to one of the Republicans key conferences. He didn\\'t get the reaction that he was looking for with Donald Trump like he got with Ali G with the ice cream glove business skit. It\\'s a shame that the scenes with Trump got cut from the final version. As for the sequence with Mike Pence. That interaction wasn\\'t as impressed in real life. Unlike the film with the long pause; Pence just continue his speech as if they weren\\'t any disruption. Cohen was quickly escort out of the building. Unlike the first Borat flick; in which the actor was famously arrested nearly 100 times and follow by the FBI. He felt that he risked his livable more making this movie due to the harsh political unrest that came with the pandemic. Cohen even said there were two separate occasions in which he had to wear a bulletproof vest. It\\'s safe to say that the rightwing rally where Borat sang an offensive song was probably one of them. While that song was somewhat catchy. It was still disturbing to see some people cheer him on. It reminds me so much of the \\'Peace\\' episode of the Da Ali G Show when Borat sang a similar tune. While I do like that Cohen mocked their echo chamber attitude toward the coronavirus outbreak for all it\\'s worth. I just wished they didn\\'t recycle the same types of the pranks that you can see on one of his old show. It made some of the sequences somewhat tiresome. Meanwhile others felt disconnected and uncompleted like the random barbershop gag. Regardless; the humor in this is probably better than what Cohen plan in the unauthorized sequel called \\'My Brother\\' starring Borat\\'s mentally-challenged brother Bilo. The cringe factor in that version would be too much to handle. Overall: Dziekuje Cohen for making the right decision. In the end; while the movie is not as good as the original. It\\'s still worth skipping sexy time to check out. A must watch.,I haven\\'t laughed so hard or have been so shocked so hard in such a long time. This movie brought to light the ugliness of the rising Fascism in the US in a comedic fashion.,It\\'s brilliant. No matter how much he tries to shock and be the crazy one in the end it always shows how the \"normal\" citizens are often much more bizarre and surreal in their own behaviour. Maria who plays the daughter deserves an Oscar for her outstanding performance. Very proud that she\\'s a Bulgarian. Over all I\\'m pleasantly surprised by the sequal because usually the 2nd never equals the first movies but this time I can whole heartily say Borat 2 is amazing and everyone needs to see it. We sure could use some more laughs in life and this movie definitely provides us with laughter but also a deeper view on how ridiculous everything is happening just in front of us.,The film certainly has its moments. Obviously it\\'s from a liberal standpoint there\\'s no attempt made to present both viewpoints; any more than there is in a Michael Moore movie. There are certainly funny moments but it\\'s not nearly as outrageous as the original. And there is some hearts in this movie as a relationship between the two protagonists grows. The part with Rudolph Giuliani is way overblown. The only person I saw touching knees was her touching him. He pats her lightly on the back not the rear end and to me it looked much more fatherly than lecherous. She made every attempt in removing his sound equipment and coaxing him into the bedroom to make him look foolish and it failed. He was simply tucking in his pants. Much ado about nothing his treatment of her was fatherly not lecherous. Since I already pay for Amazon Prime it was worth the price of admission I wouldn\\'t pay to see this at a movie theater,This was quite brilliant. America is the laughing stock. Are we not awake yet? 4 years and we\\'re still chanting \"make America great again\"? Borat showed the ugliness in power; money and politics. But we haven\\'t gotten anywhere with human trafficking which is an issue right before our very eyes daily?!? America. Wake. Up!,The movie is very disappointing. Differently from the first one; with several jokes and making funny of all; this one has an agenda and focus on politics with mostly anti-Trump. In addition; it made me laugh just a couple of times.,I loved Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. His newest film did not have the same feel; more staged than his previous film. The political aspect of the movie was humorous but we will have to see if it ages well over the years when everything dies down.,Boring..\\nDisrespectful to countries and any human... I liked all previous movies from Sasha... Not this one.. Hope best for him..,Terrible movie that makes you cringe. The whole premise using his \"daughter\" to meet Pence is just creepy; cringy; Keeping her in a cage bit is just sleazy. Even if you hate Trump this movie sucks.,The man\\'s a genius and a great comic mind. Brilliant,If you expect fun; then yes. There is one funny moment right at the beginnning. After that you just wait and wait .... and yawn. The only reason Cohen created this mess was Trump and elections. The film lacks everything. I also think that Cohen should finally come out of his closet. He loves men\\'s genitals way too much.,Wow.. this took nerves of steel to make! So crazy!,This rating is primarily because I LOVE how the film reveals the horrible stupidity that is behind this U.S. president; his political party; and his supporters. Of course; Texas and Oklahoma feature prominently in this! It\\'s also because I laughed quite a bit; mostly at the above stupid people. The addition of Borat\\'s daughter works well! The only thing I noticed; for me; is that the shock value from the first movie wasn\\'t in this one. I guess after 4 years of 45\\'s racist; misogynist; anti-American tweets and mumblings; I\\'ve grown accustomed to that party\\'s lies and rhetoric. Sad.As a side note; the Rudy Giuliani piece is horribly disturbing. Again; sadly not surprising; but horribly disgusting. I hope he; and his president; end up in jail. Or in a Kazakhstan gulag for life! Or stuffed into a wooden box with Kazakh Minister of Culture and top pornstar; Johnny the Monkey! Any of the 3 would suffice...,Extremely well done in an election year with the current pandemic. And absolute amazing farce with a well tied together story. Hilarious!,Absolutely hilarious! I loved it. Especially the Rudi scene.,Sacha Baron Cohen finds an actor with a comedic genius like his and the hysterical fun is now further through the roof! However; there were more scenes in this sequel that made me question how improvised they really were and whether the real people were in on the outrageous stuff happening around them; and there appears to be much more editing of these scenes. So the first movie definitely remains on the top.,Because of the cancel culture and the need to please all audiences; nowadays there are increasingly rare satire films that test the limits of humor. Borat achieved that; not skimping on dark humor; nonsense and sarcasm.,This movie had me belly laughing. It really brings to light how people think America is and how America actually is.,Wow!Sacha Baron Cohen doesn\\'t disappoint!WATCHING NOW FOR THR SECOND TIME AS I JUST GOT DONE WITH THR 1st WATCH!Will write more soon...but Rudy is totally eff\\'d!,I LAUGHED OUT LOUD!!!! honestly I do believe it was just as equally funny as the 1st movie in fact maybe even funnier because they implemented current events and we all know this year has been hella wack with Covid and all the political bs lol so In a way it was refreshing to see it all play out in a funny way through through this movie.,Sacha Baron Cohen and the makers of this moviefilm deserve a ton of credit for actually filming most of the scenes included here. Some of them are so over the top and insane you won\\'t believe they\\'re real. Borat is often hilarious and had me chuckling throughout most of the film. I think the beginning is the strongest; however the ending is pretty good. The plot is better than you would expect and the movie pushes it along fairly well. This movie likely won\\'t age as well as the first one though given how focused on current events it is.It\\'s essentially a piece of propaganda for the upcoming election; but that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t funny.,Too many low reviews from the offended - I liiiike . Did well after being so well known but then I suppose if there\\'s one place that has so many gullible folk with their heads stuck where there\\'s no sun,One of my favorite scenes was Cohen; wearing a Klan getup; running through a crowded conservative Republican event featuring VP Pence. Cohen shouts: \"I\\'m Stephen Miller.\" \"Let me through; I\\'m Stephen Miller.\"The setups of situations exposing misogyny and gender stereotypes were brilliant. The Guiliani segment was priceless; as was the Qanon brothers expose.Cohen did an amazing job of getting this film wrapped and ready for presentation just before the election. Hats off to production staff; makeup; set decoration; director; and actors. Loved it.,Usually I don\\'t like stupid or under the belt humor... And I even avoid crude humor... but... Well it may be even offensive... but...\\nBut even if Borat may be one of the most recent \"dumb films\"; it\\'s loaded with some accurate truth; politically incorrect maybe (maybe correct too much?); and addressing issues nobody would like to talk about (or does); which describes our society today; without hiding behind a false \"reality\" ; including during an epidemic. Wait for the ending! It\\'s political? Hell yes. Is it fun? Hell yes. (At least for the open minded).\\nYou don\\'t care about politics? Hell yes!\\nI Move to Kazakhstan!,Rudy\\'s hand in his pants was the least of his problems. His lies about coronavirus are as blatant as Trump\\'s.,If you liked the first one and thought it was funny; you\\'ll feel the same about this one. Any poor reviews are simply offended Trumpers.,I haven\\'t laughed that much in a long time. That was great!,Fantastic movie! Can\\'t wait to see it again. The ending was absolute genius. I wonder how many idiots will actually believe it?? Borat 3 please ASAP!!,This film (like the other one) is a satirical film on republicans people; so if you are one of them; and you have sense of humor; watch it; but if is not like that I think you will be triggered. 😊\\nPS: smile tomorrow could be to late.,Just like the majority of all sequels this pales in comparison to the first Borat film. The first Borat was near genius and incredibly funny but even Borat points out that he is too recognisable to pull the story off one more time. Hence a lot of the so called \\'real people\\' feel like actors or people who are just going along with the joke. Yes it certainly not the fault of Cohen that his film was so successful he can no longer get away with it; but perhaps it\\'s a shortfall in thinking that it was worth going for a second shot. It just felt a little desperate and also rushed; too focussed on what they thought was a gigantic satirical opportunity; that being 2020; the year from hell. Yes they were right; grab the bull by the horns but the bull had already dashed unfortunately. Nice try Sascha but no gold medal; maybe a bronze if you are lucky.,Twice! Seriously; I was laughing so hard that I couldn\\'t hold it in. The jokes won\\'t land for about 43% of the United States. But for the 53% on the right; or should I say left side; this will be hilarious.If you are tempted to down vote my review at this point; then this movie definitely is not for you. I encourage everyone else to to watch. The plot is somewhat slow but the comedy more than makes up for it.I owned and watched the original many times and I will watch this again. I\\'m frequently on my phone or working on my computer while watching TV or movies; but my phone stayed in my pocket the entire time. I believe that is as much a testament as dumptrump and Borat fans need.,Wow! There\\'s too much content here to properly synthesize this film; i\\'m flustered. It\\'s just too damn funny. Beyond the obvious political agenda and glaringly satirical overtones; Cohen has reproduced the *perfect* comedy for all personality types...mature personality types...so long as one refuses to get caught up in the sarcastic details. Not to mention the whole idea is to comfort all those who feel \"lost\" in these uncertain and unfamiliar times. Borat; once again; reminds us that once we stop caring about the societies overwhelming idiosyncrasies; we can all live in social harmony. Yes; i will admit some of the themes felt...forced. Being where we are as a race; i still believe this is a very strong and relevant work of art. Absolutely hilarious. I have left spoilers out so your first viewing experience can be a...hmmm...what\\'s the phrase....ah right....great success!,Best comedy made after Borat 1. If you don\\'t like this movie you have no sence of humour. Great Success Sacha Baron Cohen.,I loved the first Borat but this was awful; a movie made to help skew and election when most people watch movies to remove themselves from everyday life and the dominant election.What a waste of 2+ hours; I would say \\'that\\'s two hours I\\'m never getting back\\' but fortunately our clocks went back so I got 1 hour back.Movie wasn\\'t funny; SBC obviously has issues; the movie was about selling an underaged girl who is getting implants so he needs to get his head checked because that\\'s not comedy.Just rewatch the original.,Absolutely disgusting film; so oppressive towards women. No wonder the male-female authority still exists of films like this are being made. There is no funny element about this film; and I am shocked that in 2020 films like this are still allowed to be made.,I no longer go into watching a film with high or low expectations. I go in subjectively. SBC has never been even remotely funny. I watched the first one to see how stupid a suprising majority of U.S. citizens were in respects to the unfunny; crude,\"Finally a good sequel; i think this is a better then the first one; it\\'s more interesting; more funny; and of course more shocking; this sequel proof Sacha Baron Cohen acting skill after 14 years not to be Borat character and his acting is still awesome; not less but better; i highly recommend; but make sure watch the first one first\",Finally someone has the guts to show how sad this country has become and make us laugh while doing it. Not an easy thing to do.,You really have to wonder how this film came together; especially with some of the scenes at the end. Mind you; I guess they really did roll with the times quite well; because I suspect that as things changed dramatically around March 2020 they had to completely rework the script at the last minute; but then again CoVid really did take the world by surprised (not that we didn\\'t see anything like this coming; it is just that we basically live in our own little bubbles; and don\\'t expect things that happen on the other side of the world to really affect us all that much).Look; I\\'ve never been a particularly big fan of Cohen; and I wasn\\'t a particularly big fan of his first film; but a part of me wanted to see this film; even if it was because I was captivated by the trailer. It turned out to actually be pretty good; and surprisingly I found myself bursting out in laughter numerous times during the film. However; the thing that I thought was great was how the film simply seemed to roll with the times; especially since halfway through we have Borat wandering around the empty streets wandering where everybody has gone (and ends up shacking up with some conservatives for five days).Actually; that scene was pretty cool; because while on one hand there is the suggestion that he was mocking their beliefs; he was also demonstrating to us that they are actually nice guys. The fact that they let this guy stay with them for five days; and didn\\'t get upset despite some of the really weird things that he was doing; and even went as far as to point out that his book was wrong; really does go to show that these people aren\\'t actually the monsters that some people make them out to be.Mind you; the end scene is an absolute classic; and as Cohen indicates; we really should make up our mind as to what was really going on. It was quite funny though that the person that the joke was a target of thought that he had out played Cohen; without actually realising what was actually going on. Of course; once the film was released you can imagine that this person has immediately gone into damage control.I guess one of the problems with a film like this is that you aren\\'t going to get the real reactions that you would if it wasn\\'t being recorded; though I understand that Cohen does get into these things by pretending to be somebody completely different. However; the rather deadpan faces that you get with some of the scenes; such as in the family planning clinic and in the hardware store; as well as in the store with the fax machine; does suggest that while it was odd; it was not something that was really going to raise concerns (which no doubt would have had a completely different result if; say; they were using hidden cameras in the clinic).I tell you what though; Maria Bakalova was absolutely outstanding in this film; and she just falls into the role so well. The other thing is the way that they use language - like; I have no idea what they are speaking; and it certainly sounds as if they are communicating with each other; despite the fact that Bakalova is speaking Bulgarian; and Cohen is speaking Hebrew Gibberish (I\\'m not even sure if that is actually a language). Yet; they do it so well; and it comes across so authentic; despite the fact that it is all a put on.Yeah; this is actually a pretty cool film; and I must say that I really did enjoy it; even though it does make you feel uncomfortable in parts. Personally; I wouldn\\'t necessarily call it eye opening; and I doubt that it is going to change the election all that much; but it was still a pretty good watch. Oh; and I did quite like the bit at the beginning where he actually played up the fact that he can\\'t really walk around dressed as Borat anymore.,Though; not nearly as funny as the first film ; and several \"gasp worthy\" scenes short as the previous; this was a great way to appease the Borat in us all. Yeah; the political rhetoric is obviously Anti-Trump; but hey; it\\'s 2020 and everyone is pissed off at something. I found a few moments that sparked a laugh; and generally entertaining throughout. But what can Cohen do? Kids; senior citizens and everyone between know of Borat. It\\'s not like he can hide anywhere! The costumes were a great addition!\\nSuper curious how many Civil suits the production company and Cohen get hit with... but I\\'d watch this again!! Give it a whirl!!,This movie is filled with propagranda and it\\'s not funny in the slightest.,There is a reason certain people are angered by this film. It shows the stuff they are willing to put up with. Funny and truthful!,Tackles all social issues going on in this world with great humour;sometimes uncomfortable but that is what Mr.Cohen does best.Timing of this movie is perfect and a great time for bringing Borat back and laugh at the sad state of affairs that we are in.,Had to make an account on here just for this movie. It was hilarious in its typical fashion and anyone saying it was all staged hasn\\'t done their research. He truly did impede on the February Michael Pence CPAC. The scenes with Rudy were legit; amongst some others yet to be told. I\\'m rating a 10 just in hopes of countering butthurt Trump fans that are rating it poorly.,I guess we know what Sasha Baron Cohen has been doing while in quarantine!!\\nI think I\\'ll just make a possibly large budget; multi national film at the drop of a hat. Now that is power my friend!\\nVery current! Much better than the previous ones.\\nI could see a lot of growth and I think more of Sasha Baron Cohen; the man and artist; in this movie.\\nIt dealt with so many different current issues and beliefs and was not really political because he poked fun at and exposed all sides.\\nMostly he exposed the inappropriateness of us not getting along with one another in the USA.\\nI think I have described my take on the movie without giving away any specifics.\\nIt is silly; so know that up front.\\nIf you feel offended; wait 2 minutes and you will be laughing as he lands on another subject.\\nHis sidekick in the movie was a great find! Casting miracle! Lucky!,The first Borat movie was basically a documentary of him just going around town saying racist and sexist things. but in this new movie; it is basically more of a movie than a documentary. It centers around Borat trying to get his daughter pretty to be able to marry someone. and that\\'s basically the whole story. the reason I think this is a movie more than a documentary is because it focuses around Love and family; and how Borat finds true love for his daughter rather than needing to. there were a few funny things from this movie but there\\'s no way that it could be funnier than the first one. If it were; there would actually be execution\\'s towards them. the first film was way more racist and sexist. while this movie focused on being pretty much just sexist material because race is a harder thing nowadays. I thought it was entertaining Irina Nowak really shined and basically took the mantel for being the female version of Borat. Funny; racist; sexist. you know... all that good stuff. its definitely a good movie with some good jokes in it so if you like the first one; you should at least check this one out.,Not as funny as the original but this film has less skits and more story; probably because Borat is too recognizable. It\\'s more like 7/10 but gave it a 10 to balance out the Republican snowflakes.,Sums up the whole story as republicans vs science; if you didn\\'t like this movie then you\\'re probably one of the guys that attended the rally,Very Nice; Great Success. This movie bring glory to Kazakhstan.,The movie is too childish; but very offensive. I made it to 18 minutes. The scene at this point was too much for me.That would be fine if the movie was funny like the first Borat movie; but this one is just awfull and not funny at all.,Terrible; offensive and not funny... waste of time!,The five minutes of humiliating Crazy Rudy was great (which is why I\\'m giving this great gobbling turkey as many as two stars) but I\\'m actually angry about the other hour-and-a-half when I could\\'ve been doing something worthwhile. Like sleeping. If you haven\\'t seen it yet the Giuliani snippet is very near the end. You don\\'t need the rest of it.,Just not funny. Don\\'t waste your time. He tries to set people up but it\\'s just not funny anymore,Just as good as the first one. And it was refreshing comedy; and a good take on the current social climate,Sacha Cohen is a true gem and this film proves it. To film this (secretly) during a pandemic was a superb achievement and risky. Borat unmasks some of the illnesses of society with his wit and solid preparation. This film is incredibly vulgar; inappropriate; politically incorrect; offensive and hilarious and so much needed during times like these.,Relevant to current scenario and entertaining at the same time.,Wait how can it be Borat when it was Randy Marsh??,I laughed so much but so much. This film is one of the best in 2020. if someone says it\\'s bad; don\\'t believe it. There must be some group criticized by the film.,Very nice. I like. This movie will bring back pride to glourious nation of Kasahstan.,I\\'m generally not a comedy guy. I did see the first Borat and found it to be a hodge-podge of prank sketches with some very funny gags.Sacha Baron Cohan\\'s follow-up improves over the original with a more story-based approach that still upends the \\'-isms\" in America (racism; sexism; etc.) in the midst of a freaking pandemic. It couldn\\'t be more well-timed in this brutal election season.The standout is Borat\\'s 15 year old daughter played by Maria Bakalova (she\\'s actually 24) who steals the show with her cluelessness and likeability.How well you enjoy this movie will depend on your own level of political ideology and tolerance to very crude and crass behavior. Personally; I found it hilarious. But it is definitely not for everybody.,Sacha Baron Cohen is a brilliant comedien- the problem he has found after the first Borat and Bruno was his fame made it more difficult for him to prank people- which is itself satirized in the movie.Borat remains a clever creation; but for me the best and most cringe inducing scenes featured Maria Bakalova- a natural comic actress who excels in some genuinely shocking scenes (Rudi Guliani in a bedroom.....). I suspect this film will be remembered as her debut in future years. Good to see Borat back; but a star is truly born as well- I suspect she will become a big star after this.,I\\'m from the U.K. I\\'d like to see a film-maker from Kazakhstan lampooning us. They would do it very well and with more wit. But evidently they have too much class.There were some funny moments in this film; but it was mostly lame and boringly lewd at times.It also copied Sarah Cooper (who is infinitely more entertaining) with the Usual Suspects bit.,It\\'s too bad that he\\'s more relevant than ever. That said; I dont think QAnon or the Obamagate people\\'s mind\\'s will be changed; but hopefully it helped show some people how ridiculous our action\\'s look online.I thought it was pretty good; for just being an updated version (with a female lead!) of the first movie. It\\'s funny how quickly people forget embarassment and let their guard\\'s down and get fooled again.Objectively (IMO) not as good as We Are America but better than Borat 1; though I don\\'t see why it would be as successful; the shock and awe is gone. We all feel how we feel about Trump and I don\\'t think this movie is going to motivate anyone on the other side of it\\'s Aisle.,Most sequels are boring re-hashes of their original and better works Borat 2 is as good as the original and builds on the themes of stupidity that The first film delved into. Well done SBC,Borat is back; but the first movie was better and more hilarious,Borat is back; and his second film does as much as can be done with the character in 2020. He is accompanied by his daughter Tutar who does a fine job of adding to the wacky comedy. The first half is still as great as the original but it declines as it\\'s clear that their plans have fallen through and they have to desperately improvise. It is also let down by being too scripted. Overall; a fine achievement that adds a lot to the original film but does not reach its heights in the end.,I\\'ll be quite honest although there was quite funny scenes but with borat there was to little what you see in trailer some of it you wouldn\\'t see like borat movie daughter went up to the roof of the car and the police talked to borat that never happened in the actual movie so that was disappointing when they say borat is number 4 and tutar is number 3 is so stupid like she wasn\\'t all that funny it felt like a tutar movie then a borat movie it shows trump right hand man almost having sex with her and she was 15 years old so there is some exposure when it comes to politics we saw more Tutar then borat it felt like kinda staged and at the end Tutar wearing a borat suit and having a boy\\'s haircut felt like she was immating being a man truly a feminist lesbian borat film and why kill of asamat batatov and it was kinda offensive to coronavirus victims saying borat caused the virus so obviously this film was shot before coronavirus and when coronavirus started it shows more of her then borat quite a disappointment I understand rules have changed but you still could of made it into a better film it kinder changed borat personality now he allows women equality it felt like a woke film to me but there was funny scenes and they had 12 more mins then the original and still showed less of borat it\\'s not a bad film but not great either,I fell on the floor laughing in the first Borat film where Borat and Azamat are naked in the elevator. The whole thing was funny. This time not so much. The dialogue between Borat and his daughter was so frustrating. Him speaking in Hebrew and her answering in Bulgarian for minutes at a time. Getting a fax machine employee to send stupid messages where the guy is clearly smirking at this was just not funny. The Trump hate was clearly in line with the host of late night talk shows and very mundane and repetitive. We get it the media hates him and would rather have you vote for anyone else. Cohen\\'s strength is his subtlety and mastery of language; the ability to twist words. He did not have an opportunity here due to his recognizable face in any outfit. The result is gibberish conversation in two different languages that has no meaning.,I\\'m a massive fan of the original and this film too deserves a watch; however it loses its edge and appeal as everyone knows who he is and it\\'s the stupidity of the public that makes the film work .. Cohen appears to be doing an impression of Borat; the voice is even different,People think this guy is a genius? Showing a man\\'s behind; strap on penises etc. is not comedy. That\\'s stuff that 10 year olds laugh about. What\\'s next? Fart jokes? Even the poster photo looks like trying too hard to make people who want to laugh laugh.,Couldn\\'t give it a 0 rating. Orange Man Bad. Why orange man so bad?,I was a huge fan of the first one. This one misses the mark. It\\'s crude; goes too much for shock. It wasn\\'t funny I actually was bored in it. Really have no idea how it is currently rated a 7 it\\'s nowhere near that.,Worst movie ever; right next to \"It\\'s Pat\". Epic fail on trying to gaslight negative situations on the republican party right before the election. A poor example of what the left thinks humor is.....we\\'ve seen so much better from Cohen....we need more humor; and less garbage politicking...shameful,Outstanding performance by the Bulgarian actress !!!\\nBe a good LAD and please sing\\n\\'\\'Boyko Borisov PEDERAS PEDERAS\\'\\'\\nwhen you\\'re accepting that oscar !\\nBe the Tutar all bulgarians would be proud of !love; Bristol,The thesis of both Borat movies is that Americans are generally willing to put up with far too much to avoid rocking the boat; and that this is dangerous.,Maybe not the best story ever but all the stupid things in it will make the ride funny.. I laughed my ass off in a few parts.. if you are a fan of borat you will like,Amazing; not as good as the original one. Still a 9/10.,We could all use some humor these days. This is a must watch. It is simply remarkable the way he is able to trick ordinary people.,Just a political; election year; rushed; poor movie. Sasha is such a smart guy; who made some awesome movies but this one is by far the worst. It\\'s just anti Republican smear movie; it got no other punch lines. with all political stuff this year; this movie just piles on more on top. If you are die hard democrat you will love the movie; if you non political or republican then this movie is just sad. Sasha can do much better then this.,This is a huge disappoinment. The first part was funny and fresh; while this is just disgusting. Turned it off after 33 minutes. Also the film is so dark you can\\'t see much most of the time. This sequel is a disgrace! Do not waste your time on it.,Not funny and fake. This isn\\'t a comedy; it\\'s a juvenile political attack job; and I\\'m not even American. The stereotypical character portrayals are not believable unless you\\'re a simple minded twit. What a waste of time!,Barely anything form the original Borat film was showcased here. What remains is a political propaganda piece designed to smear Republicans and only Republicans. How much can one sell out? Sasha\\'s career dies here.,Just a disgusting vile film. Humor for a 12 yr old boy. Degrading to women,I was expecting some good laughs from this film. All I get is a film that feels very staged for the most part. This movie feels very politically motivated where they attack one side and not the other. An extreme disappoint.,Very funny and outrageous until it stopped being funny. Turned out to be another opinion of a far left Hollywood celebrity. Too outrageous until it became much too much. I\\'ll pass on the next Sasha film.,Not over the top when you see what is being exposed in American life. Wow. The best satire on film since Dr. Strangelove.,After 14 years we received an irreverent sequel at the height of the first. It is true that it does not surpass the original but the songs it deals with and the way it does it will always have the stamp of Cohen as borat and that is more than enough to be happy with this new installment.,Just wow. Incredible; this was a mirror shown to the American society. What in the world happened to the USA?,I am mostly sorry I spent my time watching this.\\nThe first Borat film was a satire and had funny moments but this one is just cheap radical propaganda.\\nIt is clear that in every society one can find problematic groups or individuals.\\nSacha Baron Cohen decided to be the poster boy of the Democratic Party by feeding the viewers conspiracy lies about the Republicans.\\nIn one word - PRIMITIVE!\\nAnd actually really not funny.,Cant stop laughing sorry.\\nThis is artistically morbid\\nShocking depraving gore but at least it shows how sick is the society nowadays,I loved the first one and this doesn\\'t disappoint. I\\'m very much right wing so I don\\'t get the republicans getting upset learn to laugh at yourself. If you\\'re easily offended and have no sense of humour no you won\\'t like it. If you\\'re blessed with a sense of humour; can laugh at yourself you will love it. Baron Cohen deserves credit for how brave he is he genuinely puts his life on the line. Plus his on screen daughter is a delight.,I was expecting more given the hype. It was basically a 90 minute slow build up to a pretty anti-climactic scene with Rudy Giuliani.,And that was disappointing because to be fair prior to an election parts were removed so it would not be banned by \\'you know who\\'. The Guiliani embarassment is there but I assume the trump skit was left out due to political pressure.,Trust me when I say that I\\'ve watched *many* movies this year; given the current situation; and this I regret every minute of watching this movie. I think I\\'ve gotten more laughs from a nature documentary. This is movie is pretty mind-numbing and boring.Go watch a recent Adam Sandler movie if you want more laughs; and don\\'t bother with this steaming pile of garbage.,I loved Ali G; Borat; even The Dictator. But this is hot garbage. Cohen is just pandering to the lowest common denominator for cheap laughs; and regularly misses the mark. Deceptive editing; actors playing the supposed \"real people;\" and parroting of the same played out political tropes we\\'re all beyond sick of.Do yourself a favor and just watch the trailer - all the funny moments are in it anyway. Then flip on the original; it\\'s superior in every metric.,Borat is hilarious and a treat to watch... Again! BUT this was much less of a social satire than the first one and it was too literal politically. Many scenes; such as the father-daughter ball; even though hilarious; make you think they were put in there just to have the good old Borat doing his thing. And they make you wonder: Are they really integral to the story? (Not really). What are they trying to say? (Unclear). To whole satire of the civilized western society trying to educate Borat in the first film; was much more effective and spot-on.,Not doubting genius of SKB but current times is not suitable to enjoy this kind of comedy based on reality,I was expecting more this time around. However; the movie disappointed me; as it was very similar to previous movies; relying on shocking and misleading \\'participants\\' for comedy; with a weak plot holding it together.On the positive side; while continuing to expose prejudices; he also showed the warm side of Americans such as older Jewish women and right wing men.The famous Giuliani scene was not as damning as expected. While he was lecherous; he was mostly charming and supportive.,Sacha is back as Borat; and by gods is it a cringeworthy cocktail of hilarity. There\\'s lots of folk that won\\'t like this and simply dismiss it as crass and dumb; and on the surface you could be forgiven for thinking so; but it is anything but. Sacha is his usual amazing self; always staying in character through situations that would quite frankly have me pissing my pants laughing. The real treat here is his daughter. I\\'ve never seen Maria Bakalova before; but she more than holds her own on the screen and even outshines in a lot of scenes. Equally as fearless and fun as Sacha and a great sport for putting herself in a potentially bad situation with a prominent American figure. Trump supporters will no doubt cry fake and throw stones; but without verging into spoiler territory I\\'d say it was pretty obvious what happened and I\\'ll say no more; other than I doubt Sacha would compromise his artistic integrity by lying. It was clear to me his only concern was cutting it short to keep his co star safe and unharmed. Good man!,I\\'m not concerned about his political message.I simply found it to be disrespectful to women and disgusting.This time he took it too far; and that\\'s saying a lot.,When I watch comedies then I like to watch them to be light hearted and hopefully somewhat intelligent. This movie is a 90 minute political propaganda movie with absolutely no laughs.Even the Giuliani \\'hands down the pants moment\\' is sooo staged! His face is covered in parts. The actress basically untucks his shirt and Giuliani; a 76 yr old fat man; goes to tuck them back in - and the movie just got their perfect fake news moment to promoted themselves. Probably the only reason people actually go to watch the movie.The whole premise is silly - that Kazakhstan govt released the Wuhan virus because they were angry at the world for laughing at them.And I used to think Cohen was an intelligent man; but looks like he has lost that magic and hence why this movies is hoping to cash in on some Trump/Republican bashing. Shame Cohen can\\'t have success just on his own but has to lean in on Trump/Republican and election time to try and profit.Total bore of a movie. and if you have 90 minutes of time to waste then go ahead and watch grass grow; it will be better than watching this movie.,In the current state of America; tensions are already high. Borat is here to fuel the fire against the republicans - if you\\'re looking for a movie that\\'s 90 minutes of \"LoOk At HoW sTuPiD tRuMp SuPpOrTeRs Are!\" then this is the title for you.It\\'s a complete disappointment. And as others have mentioned; it\\'s been rushed to come out before the election and that\\'s very obvious. The production quality is low; the story is basic and almost non-existant; the characters lack depth. There\\'s about 5 funny scenes in the entire thing. Not at all worth anybody\\'s time.,I wasn\\'t excited for Borat 2 because I didn\\'t love the original which I seen back in 2007 so I was 18. Both films are fine; I don\\'t know which is better.The humor is inconsistent; it works sometimes. Yes; I laughed out loud a few times like the Trump stuff. Borat is really edgy like the original in fact the period scene disgusted me. There are some forced jokes like Borat running around half naked and the plot was forced.If you loved Borat; you probably seen this already. If you hated Borat; you may hate this even more. If you didn\\'t mind Borat like myself; it\\'s worth seeing once.,I don\\'t understand why poeple say it\\'s not as good as the 1st movie; i watched the 2 today and they\\'re both funny and it\\'s pretty much the same style that i\\'d never guess it\\'s 14 years between the 2 movies already; this movie is truly much better in the technical aspect and it has more funny moments too at least for me; the actress who played the daughter did an amazing job and i liked her character development; so she added a lot to the concept of Borat.\\nI really enjoyed this movie a lot and i hope poeple will stop comparing the 2 because it felt more like a continuity.,Just watch all the old clips of Ali G on youtube. You\\'ll have a blast. That show was incredibly funny and still holds up.,Oh dear. I do wish film studios would stop funding fake reviews.This film is such a let down. I think I laughed once and it wasn\\'t at the humiliation of a lovely old Jewish lady or the vulgar menstrual blood dance.The first Borat and Bruno were hilarious but this one? Nah. I think Cohen might have had his day. Even the accent was strained.,Boring and not funny; hour and a half of boredom..,Traded completely on the original film; (which was very funny). Bar a few funny moments; it was pretty dire and painful to watch. Avoid.,Funny when he\\'s just being an artist/comedian.Actors now think their political opinion matters.Ummm; Nope.What made him famous? Being hilarious.This movie is so self-indulgent. Using his fame to tear down a country where he has no responsibility. No vested interest = spewing at the mouth.I kept trying to watch. Don\\'t waste your time.,While the first movie flowed; this felt forced and quite try hard throughout. Most \"victims\" seemed aware early and everything after that just broke any sort of illusion knowing that footage was needed. It\\'s a shame as the first was a genuinely good watch; and I was thoroughly looking forward to this; but almost nothing worked here.\\nMaybe worth a watch for the most die hard of SBC fans; but I wouldn\\'t spend money on a movie ticket; wait until it\\'s streamable or on TV,I watched the this skeptical that I was going to see a lot of recycled gags and that it would come across as a desperate attempt to revive a character that should be left in the past. Instead this movie goes in a completely different direction and the satire is absolutely perfect for the year 2020.,Loved every minute of it! Looking forward to watching it again.,I consider Borat Cultural learnings etc. to be one of the best comedies ever made; so although I was excited for this; I was hesitant because I didn\\'t except it could match up to the original. I was wrong. This is some of Sacha\\'s best work; and the climax of the movie (no spoilers) is absolutely jaw dropping.I give it an 8-9 only because it didn\\'t have as much of the narrative + real world blending; a lot more of it was scripted than the original. That isn\\'t to say that this makes it boring; just that obviously Sacha is at his best during real world scenes. I must also acknowledge that many people have reviewed this quite low most likely because of political leanings; but even I; who consider myself more right leaning found this to be a completely transparent and truthful look at the sad state of America.Everyone has prime so I see no reason anyone shouldn\\'t watch this.,Unlike the first Borat movie (and his appearance in Ali G before that) this Borat movie rarely manages to drive big points home. If I had to guess; it\\'s partly because of the (ironically probably more thought through) script making it seem less genuine; relying too much on pure shock (ala Bruno); or simply being victim of measuring up to the past success of Borat.I think Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s recent Who Is America is honestly a much better watch if you\\'re interested in contemporary American politics and society. Borat: Subsquent Moviefilm simply doesn\\'t manage to show us much that\\'s worth remembering a week; a month; or a year from now (despite being linked to the election). I had a good time watching it with the family though and had more than a few laughs; so I will rate it mid way as such.,Ugh. How the mighty have fallen. I\\'ve seen better \"prank\" videos and humor from YouTube hacks with no film-making experience. Crude; discriminatory; and just awful and pointless.,Absolute garbage movie. I loved Borat back in 2006. This was just a garage follow-up. The scenes were boring and the whole setup of him \"bringing\" his daughter to USA is just plain boring. The daughter-actor was garbage too.,BSM; also known as \\'HAH! We Get The Rudy\\'; is a \\'been there done that\\' tale with less payoffs and laughs than the first BORAT. If you have followed the Press stories regarding this film......you have seen the film.,It\\'s a one joke act and once you see through it isn\\'t as funny anymore. The first one was hilarious; this one just felt like forced propaganda.Borat should\\'ve stayed back in 2006.,Every interaction they have with a person is just stupid and clearly fake; in no way do normal people react like that!,GIVE THIS FILM A 10 OR YOU WILL BE EXECUTE.Sacha Baron Cohen has writen history once more. Great success my man.,Awful. The worst movie I have ever seen. The stereotyping is very unpleasant and to some extent even fake and gives huge misconception. Deserves 0 ratings. It\\'s too politically dumb as well. I can write too much; but not worth my time. As I already wasted 2 hours of my time watching it.\\nLastly; Sacha is even hypocrite. He talks about how people should respect each other; when in fact he himself is not applying his own advice. He is talentedly exhausted and broke; and has nothing new to offer on screen.,This ridiculously outrageous movie-film makes tribute to the first Borat. It is amazing how Borat is allowed to live and breathe in the very fierce 2020 Covid atmosphere. Even through it is quite offensive; we can only laugh at the ridiculous statement people say. I thought that it wouldn\\'t work out but oh my god; it delivered!Also the character arc is amazing and how the characters changes and the disguises which reminded me of his other films. The father-daughter ending almost made me cry.This made me laugh outloud for an entire 2 hoursVery-nice!,Great moviefilm; fourth best moviefilm in all of Kazakhstan.,Ultimately it\\'s an 8-9 rating but giving it a 10 for the eventual magats that give it a 1.,For a supposed comedy it was painful to sit through; not worth watching,Too political for me; its like a borat movie made by cnn. Seems like it was rushed together for the elections.,The first Borat movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time. This was the most disappointing sequel I have ever seen. It was just terrible. Very sad; I was so looking forward to watching this movie.,The world needs to stop communism; (this communism includes Chinese socialism),Very seldom do I laugh until I cry and get a pain in my jaws.\\nI am very thankful that he made this movie just for me.,Love it if you are for Biden; hate it if you are for a good and complete film.,This doesn\\'t even compare to the first one; it\\'s very boring and not that funny. It\\'s a bit too political for me; I couldn\\'t wait for it to be over,Not that funny; not a patch on first movie and a political hit job.,NAHT.What made the first Borat great was the authenticity of it. Borat felt like a real person coming to America and divulging in the culture for the first time. This movie feels more like watching an SNL member do a terrible impression of Borat than it feels like Borat himself. At least with the former there can be some humor residing in the satire of it all. This movie is like listening to that kid you went to high school with do a poor rendition of the Borat voice for the 100th time. And we all know how pleasurable that was.,It\\'s hilarious; but I was really moved by the daughter-father story. Maria Bakalova is a star. Anyway. Go see this gem. 10 out of 10.Sorry; I forgot; it features the nicest person on earth - Jeanie :),Been long time fan of SBC. Even dressed as Ali G on Halloween. This was pure propaganda. Like the Simpsons were in off episodes. I laughed out loud once for this. It\\'s not funny to trap people and make fun of them.,I couldn\\'t care less if he made fun of Republicans; The original BORAT was hilarious. But this movie is clearly just a big ok smear campaign for the left. It\\'s just an hour and a half of BORAT Virtue Signaling to you how stupid Pro Trumpers are. Wish it could\\'ve just kept all politics out of it(or atleast remained neutral and not picked any sides).,The title says it all;this is a last ditch effort propaganda movie to smear the big bad orange man;featuring borat.,Apparently everyone now rated movies based on their political view now too. It\\'s funny; it\\'s satire. You should be able to laugh whether you are democrat or republican. I thought the jokes were well done.,Borat 2 portrays the true colors of Trump\\'s America.\\nAs the last message from the movie suggests; Go vote!Another comedy masterpiece starring Baron Cohen! Must see!!,My world is still alive. And I just started doubting that. Blown away. Easily the best entertainment of last decade. It\\'s so traumatic (in a best possible way) that credits are rolling as i type; but I can\\'t remember 90% of the gags. I feel being alive again; thanks Sacha. PS. I\\'m a \\'republican snowflake\\' and NRA member.,FAF......sacha baron cohen i\\'m really appreciate your guts man!!!!!..,...and Even though you probably should not compare the two movies; you still do. A couple of really funny and/or unbelievable scenes but most of it trying to be a normal comedy movie.\\nProbably would not watch a third one.,This Brit can make some of the wackiest stuff! I thought parts of it were hysterical and others cringeworthy.PS> my partner only give it a 1 or 2 and said that\\'s time gone from their life.,I was counting the days to watch Borat 2 as I was thinking it would be as good as Borat 1. How wrong I was... Borat 2 is boring to death. I was watching it lying down on my couch and I fell asleep halfway through the film.,Highly disappointed. There were some funny parts throughout the movie; but absolutely nothing compared to the humor in the original Borat. The real life bits weren\\'t nearly as funny; I found the daughter to be somewhat annoying; and the scripted parts ruined the movie as a whole. The original Borat was genius; one of the best comedy movies; arguably; of all time. This... was nowhere near. This was a missed chance at a great sequel.,There is a reason this went right to Amazon. We seen the first Borat at a movie theater and everyone was laughing from start to finish. This movie was not funny but just gross.,Same old Borat... which is a very good thing.I mean the only scene I disliked and cringed at was the father-daughter dance; but I laughed so hard at all the jokes about the US President... I forget his name -- just kidding I know what it is; in case republican read this. But what struck me the most was how much of a political move this was to make this movie; but raised eyebrows for me as well. I think I\\'m mostly entertained at the fact Sasha Baron Cohen is the best and most dedicated troll on Earth that doesn\\'t care about who he pisses off; as long as his own mission is complete and goals are reached.,Fairly disappointed I did expect more; but still very funny at times,A really rushed movie that was clearly made to make people not to vote for trump thats it. Laughed maybe once or twice but the problem was that it had the same jokes which was the daughter being dumb and learning stuff and that was just really boring. I understand why they made this movie but was it really necessary?,If you liked the first Borat; you\\'ll like this one as well.,I was so worried this film was going to be a disappointment after the genius of the first movie but I needn\\'t worried. Another brilliantly; hilarious experience. Loved it!,Clearly too many people already know Borat. Funny movie at times but no longer scandalous as before. Donald Trump and Co. are the new target. Perfect movie for Joe Biden\\'s campaign.,Just watched on Amazon Prime. I\\'m in my mid sixties and cringing; hooting and laughing all at the same time. Greatest respect to Sasha; the cast and crew. I think that this is better than the original. How does he get away with it??!! 10/10!!,If you like absolute silliness; outrageous behavior and total insanity; this is the film for you. True to the Borat style; where reality and fiction meet. It was dull in some parts and so funny in others that you will gag laughing. And as always; totally edgy plot lines for each scene.,Its a attempted smear campaign towards Republicans and that is litterally all it is.,Sacha felt tired and out of energy. The jokes didn\\'t pack a punch as in the first Borat movie. I ended up stopping half way through with no desire to watch the other half.,Absolutely brilliant sequel; great to have borat back and some of the scenes with his daughter are great who is also superb. Highly recommended. High Five🤚,A great addition and resolution to the first film. It delivered in ways that still felt original while still being incredibly funny. For those stating that it\\'s degrading women; are missing the point (and subject) of the majority of the film. If you feel this way I highly recommend you rewatch it and understand who exactly the film is making fun of.,It is a disgusting; repulsive slop of a movie.\\nTotally unbelieveable that it is all a series of \"hidden cam\" pranks; feels scripted all the way.\\nJust not worth your time watching it.\\nIt is also offensive how he speaks polish-kazkh made-up language; his daughter speaks in bulgarian and I watched it with Amazon\\'s official subtitles that at certain moments don\\'t have anything to do with what she\\'s saying. It is basically like they told her talk whatever you want no one will understand you anyway. The humor in this thing is deprived of any taste.,His movies are a gold standard when it comes to real social experiments used in movies... And exposes the ugly primal instincts of people... Great movie,Big fan of Borat. Thought the first movie was brilliant but this was just slow and boring.with only a few good sketches.,This is a very funny movie; but I don\\'t think it lives up to the first one. I really like how Borat\\'s relationship with his daughter grows though.The girl who plays Borat\\'s daughter is a great actress. I hope her career skyrockets because of this.,Perhaps not as good as the first but awfully close...,This is more than a hilarious comedy. This exposes the racist and intolerant underbelly of America; possibly more effectively than the original film.,Disjointed and unfunny- Borat has never been funny.,Imagine the first Borat. Now take away everything you enjoyed from the film; like the sketches with real people and shock humor and replace it with political propaganda and obviously scripted/paid actors. That\\'s basically what Borat 2 is.,One of the worst movie ever. Really bad humor or lack there of,Low ratings must be from the takedown targets of the movie. I dont think they would really watch it though.,I\\'m a big fan of Eric Andre and Frank Hassle kinda stuff; I know it\\'s dumb; but at least there are some laughs to be had. The jokes were so dry and stupid I didn\\'t crack a smile the entire time. It just seems like he was trying way too hard to be funny so it just had the opposite effect. Combine that with all of the propaganda doo doo and it\\'s basically just a massive waste of time.,Not funny at all. it\\'s a very lame repetition of the original.... don\\'t waste your time.\\nAngry liberal trying to score points among other angry liberals. It\\'s not original or not funny anymore. Humor should be beyond that....,Awful story; unfunny; terrible acting. The first borat was bad enough but this reaches new depths of awfulness.,Watching what he has done in the past. This movie just tackles and gets into the political part more than anything; which it was a dissapointment.Is worth watching if you wanna know what people were talking for a brief moment before the elections of 2020; but that\\'s about it.,After the first 45 minutes it was trash. The first movie was pure genius. This is just anti American nonsense.,It was kind of a political expose as he pranked Mike Pence and Rudy Giuliani.\\nRudy had a compromising scene in a hotel room with borat\\'s daughter which might raise some moral questions.I cried till my stomach hurt but I kinda liked the first Borat more because of the social experiments in that but this is a MUST WATCH if u can take some offensive jokes which I\\'m sure u can lmao.*there is a cameo of T_m H_nks*,A comedy movie that isn\\'t funny is like a romantic movie without a love story. This has failed on every level of \"comedy\"; don\\'t waste your time watching it.,Well; there\\'s 90 minutes of my life I\\'ll never get back. Slow; boring; and not nearly as good as the first.,There were so many occasions I began breaking out into fits of laughter and so many other moments of impulsive cringing. Unbelievably well done; we are so fortunate to have an artist like\\nSacha Baron Cohen sharing his art with us.,There are some parts that will make you smile or laugh a little but most of it is political and not really that funny. Sequels are always worst than the first one and this was true for this sequel.,This movie was not funny and cringeworthy at times. Does not come close to original.,This movie goes much deeper than anything Hollywood is used to making. This takes the natural reactions and culture of the world not a make believe idea of American culture.,Couldn\\'t have wished for a better time for a Borat subsequent movie. love Cohen; love Maria; & love the blooming daughter-father bond. enough shock value to be a Borat movie; however; we all know the very real & necessary message of this movie;),Sad reality; made me laugh at the same time.\\nHope to see other movies with Sasha soon,Not as good as his earlier movies. There are a couple of funny moments; but it\\'s mostly humor based on grossing out the audience instead of deserving bigots and powerful fools being exposed and mocked. I much prefer the latter.,This movie had some funny moments but my memories of Borat from back in 2007 are more funny than how Borat actually was and is. Borat provided a lot of laughs back then,Can see the review scores being so varied on this; but what would you expect? This just shows the stupidity of not just repressed nations but the so called land of the free under the trump Republicans control.\\nMany laugh out loud moments for me; if you don\\'t get this or are highly offended you are the problem in a 2020 world wanting to move forward into the 30s whilst preferring wanting to live in a 1620 world. In fact why are you even watching this? It\\'s on Amazon go back to BBC 1 or CBS or ABC or whatever.Funniest film of 2020Sasha you\\'ve still got it and a great breakout performance from the lovely Maria Bakalova.,Horrible movie. Only a few laughs with the rest being a propaganda film. Not even borat,Great to see Borat back in action; unfortunately the movie is notably worse than the original (is anyone really surprised?!). Still around a 7/10 and definitely Worth watching for those few classic Borat moments (not to mention the lack of any decent new content for months!); but overall it definitely could/should have been better. Not even as funny as Bruno but still had a few good laughs and better still; the nostalgia of when Borat ruled the world!!! I\\'ve been a fan since his original HBO show and I\\'m glad to see Borat still spreading his Hrum everywhere! Go in with lowish expectations and enjoy!!!,I\\'ve no doubt Sacha Baron Cohen is a talented guy but this film!! I couldn\\'t watch it all; it was awful; cringey and poor taste I turned it off after 15 minutes and that was too much! Absolute crap! I never stopped laughing at the first Borat film but didn\\'t find this funny at all,People rating with 10; are you crazy or just trols.?Totally boring movie; poor quality and story.,I didn\\'t like it at all.\\nI am a big fan of first Borat but this one ruined my good memories from the first movie.\\nThe main reason was that; the story of some one strange with American culture was already spoiled with first Borat; in fact Borat 2 was a fade version of the first one.\\nAlso I believe the character of Borat\\'s daughter wasn\\'t a cool partner for Borat. In first Borat his colleague (Azamat) was an ideal character to complete Borat\\'s character while the lack of this supporting character was obvious in the second.\\nHonestly; I was disappointed with second one while the first one was one of the best comedies I\\'ve seen.,It\\'s not filmed with a secret camera; so he has gone into all these interviews with these \"Unhuman Monsters\" with a cameraman? and its not hidden in a bag; as the camera moves round. I mean the cake shop; now the woman might have just been out for money; but she would not have done that on camera; as he shop would be finished which I would hope it now is,10/10 very NICE. A return to form with a wonderful addition of Tutar; Borat\\'s daughter.,Note there are some spoilers. Its important to recognize that to a degree this was or attempted to be a political commentary and as one it fell flat. The 3 major spots it hit on were 1. the pence/cpac scene. Opening is funny but the disdane and disgust on the face of pence showed it was an inappropriate and mistimed joke. 2. on the list is the rights rally and it stands to say in my research i found that there is actually a very large amount from that scene that didnt make it in the film. And finally 3. guiliani (its spelled wrong) unfortunately this scene is not a satire scene. Telling; disheartening and most of all disgusting but belongs more as a scandal and catch a creep than in a satire film.Now the good stuff. Despite politics the movie actually gives a lot of hope in the people of this country. The biggest part for me was the synagogue scene with the old lady. To have such a genuinely nice lady like that. She took cohen\\'s character at face value and was nothing but polite and nice and even fed him. The same sentiment was felt with the 2 men who took him in during quarantine. Political opinions aside the reality is they took him in of their own free will and volition and helped out a person who needed a place to stay.In short when the research is done on the film it is even more heart warming to see some of the things in the film. And should be watched.,Tons of adult fun; and the real scenes with Pence and Giuliani take the cake. Brilliant in so many ways; politically motivated; and executed very well. Bravo...bine le ai facut.,The original was offensive but funny. This movie is offensive and not funny. Totally degrading of women. Some people say that is the whole point of the movie but it\\'s very strange to disgrade people to an unrealistic degree to make a point.,Almost all of the interactions are clearly staged. It\\'s transparent.Most of the attempts at humour seem designed primarily to serve a political agenda. So Baron-Cohen has gone from once daring comedian to political activist with comedy an afterthought.,This is satire of the highest order. I haven\\'t laughed that hard in quite sometime. Maria Bakalova is a complete revelation and (almost) steals the show. A 10 * movie.,Baron Cohen is a genius. Honestly this is one of the funniest films ever and just as good as the first one; if not better!,When I first saw the original Borat movie I thought it was amazing. This one is just equally good if not better at many points. Sascha Baron Cohen is a true artist when it comes to exsposing the true Nature of Modern society and he does it while maintaining a good and positive sense of humour. From the top politician to the well-manered family to the everyday delivery man who does not seem to be bothered by the fact that a human person is trapped within a box. He grabs the most essential problems today and showcases them in brutal but yet honest ways and he does not care. I\\'ll guess that is what makes these movies so damn good.,The movie is extremely bad and exaggerated. It is so anti-trump that it is laughable; and also in perfect release for the election.,Great success! Releasing this movie a week and a half before the election is comedic timing at its greatest! Super cringe at moments; hilarious at others; all around this movie film was amazing!! Hi five! Also; get out there and vote!,I didnt think this movie would be amazing so many years after the original but it was very very funny. I generally do not laugh out loud at movies but this had me going the whole way through. There was a lot of cringe so if you like that and the style of comedy of Borat 1 you\\'ll love the sequel.,A lot of it is silly; but overall; it\\'s quite funny. The scene with Borat and his daughter dancing was both disgusting and funny. I imagine some people won\\'t like it; and I can understand why; but I thought it was funny.,Watched this with a few friends ans we were howling with laughter many times! You\\'ll love it!,The predecessor from 2006 is better; more authentic; and has a greater number of funny scenes. The context back then also makes you convinced how the interviewee would agree to have a camera around and would be OK being filmed. But this time; some scenes seem staged with \"actors\" in on the joke; like the scene with the \"babysitter.\" If she\\'s not an actress; how is a camera in that situation justified? At any rate; Maria Bakalova is the true revelation here. She can certainly hold her own; and her commitment is impressive. Notice how she doesn\\'t hesitate to eat the lipstick; and then Borat immediately copies her; like \"That is funny and brilliant. Let me be seen doing that too!\",Borat keeps exposing the worst America has to offer; and if you don\\'t that then the joke is probably about you!,Haha it must take some bottle to do those things 😂 really enjoyed it!Great watch!,Funnier than the original because the US has changed and the film highlights this to brilliant comic effect.,Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s revival of our favourite Kazakh reporter is another stroke of genius; and Maria Bakalova adds to the fun as Borat\\'s daughter; playing a brilliant role.Although not as racy as the first film (probably due to legal lessons learned) this is still typical Borat for the fans.,Sascha Baron Cohen has no problem caving to Hollyweird by going after Mike Pence or framing Rudy Giuliani before a major election but he would never have the stones to do a movie about Joe Biden and his corrupt family. The sequel falls flat on it\\'s face in comparison to the original; a movie that I actually laughed at and enjoyed.,Typical over-the-top; childish; gutter soup ... as expected.\\nNot made for children but made for children.,With the return of Borat; I did not expect it to be entertaining but it prove me wrong. With this film; it has more meaning to it especially with family values. I love this a lot especially the twist at the end.,Wow! just when you think Borat couldn\\'t get any more outrageous and bold he outdid himself in the biggest way possible. Is it better than the first one? Me personally no; but its still better than most of the movies that are playing out there.,A true smorgasbord of comedic stylings!!! taming the pc and bold alike...very nearly making; truly; equal fun of all people. a full folly! all sorts of cringe an absurdly fascinating wow wow wow. damn.CONCEPTUAL AND EDITING GENIOUS!!!,Pointless and reputative. Nothing new or interesting overly political and boring,The most ridiculous; senseless; disgusting and pointless comedy I\\'ve ever seen. Couldn\\'t watch more than 10 minutes of the movie. I hoped to enjoy a good comedy like The dictator; but was deeply disappointed.,Stupid; just stupid. Not worth my time. I watched to see what the big Giuliani thing was about; it as just him adjusting his pants. I can\\'t believe that this movie got any good reviews; simply not funny,Its great seeing Borat return with a sequel but the jokes are a little forced this time around. Its OK ; just don\\'t expect it to be as funny as the first.,Movie flat and not funny...BUT Maria Bakalova is a fresh new star...Worth your time to see her in action...but dat\\'s it...,Some geniuine laughs in this; I respect Cohen is gutsy enough to make these kind of jokes whether staged or not. Although I didn\\'t mind the daughter story line I felt like it would of been better if he was solo. Other sequels spring to mind where a daughter was introduced such as dumber and dumber to and jay and silent Bob: reboot; both which where very disappointing. Overall funny but can\\'t compare to the first but still an overall decent film. I mean the moon dance come on....,This movie is hilarious!!! Don\\'t listen to the negative comments about the movie! It is just the Trumplicans are upset that they are being called out on their BS!,People will go see this movie expecting more of the LOL-inducing hijinx that Sasha Baron Cohen brings as Borat; but I hope they\\'ll be pleasantly surprised by how much heart this sequel brings to the table. Much more plot-driven and emotional than its predecessor; maybe a tempering of expectations is needed but still a very fun and rewarding watch nonetheless.,Sacha baron cohen is a comedy genius. If you don\\'t laugh at this movie you\\'re dead inside,Repulsive movie; lowest kind of humor possible. Don\\'t waste 90 minutes of your time on this awful movie. I am genuinely surprised that Amazon even chose to be streaming it.,Nothing really bad about it; it never pulled me in and made me feel invested.,Giving a 10; to plump the 1 star reviews by the Trump brigade.,I was not expecting this movie to be so good to be honest. I laughed out loud and I applaud everyone that was brave enough and so clever to make such an amazing movie in a time of need. Thanks!!,Not being a huge fan of the first Borat film; I was surprised to find myself laughing out loud so much for this sequel. It had more heart in it too. The relationship growth between Borat and his daughter Tutar was kind of sweet.I enjoyed being horrified by the extremely uncomfortable moments. All except the part regarding Rudy Giuliani. The Tutar character (Borat\\'s daughter) poses as a reporter to interview \"America\\'s Mayor\". She\\'s nervous; awestruck; flirtatious; and the old man just ate that up. He kept reaching across to touch her hands to \"reassure\" her. He has no problem being led into a bedroom by her and even lays back on the bed to adjust something in his pants. Zero funny about that.Unlike all the other uncomfortable moments in the film; this part just angered and nauseated me. It wasn\\'t rehearsed or fictional; and I guess that\\'s the point. That was the Real Rudy. A creepy and lecherous monster. A definite skin-crawling scene.Seems like Sacha Baron Cohen has matured. He wrote a much better film that mixes the fictional characters with the real people in a more effective way. In the first Borat film; which I didn\\'t hate; just wasn\\'t keen on it; the character was obnoxious for obnoxiousness sake. This time around; there\\'s a definite message.Oh yeah; and there are lots of gross-out moments; much to the amusement of the 13-year-old portion of my brain. I\\'ll be repeat viewing.Watch for the Tom Hanks appearance - fantastic moment!,Didn\\'t laugh so hard with a movie for years; SBC it\\'s an amazing actor and with humor tests the frailties of our society; giving us this masterpieces,Mr. Cohen gets laughs by embarrassing others in vulnerable moments. How about we find some special private moments in his life and set him up for embarrassment? How will he handle seeing himself or family members shamed? Make funny laugh laugh? A contest anyone?,Don\\'t waste your time; It\\'s not like the first one; just a massive cringe fest.... Its almost as if the movie was motivated by politics and not entertainment.\\nSasha man; you can do better.....very disappointed.,I\\'m a huge fan of the first movie which I watched at least 5 times. This one however; is horrible. Nearly everything is scripted and full with \"cheap\" laughs. Feels like some kind of slapstick someone that likes Jeff Dunham would enjoy.,Being a big fan of the first film; was very disappointed this time around. the shocking unexpected vulgar comedy that made up the success for the first production felt very unapparent in this sequel. The for shadowing of jokes was to upfront making a lot of the comedy predictable and less enjoyable whilst lacking the shocking surprise from a vulgar joke.,I understand the fact that this movie got good reviews and high stars for the people it is against in government. But after all it is supposed to be a comedy movie. And as a comedy this is worse than average. Not funny except for few scenes. And people praise the acting; but there is nothing special about it.,Funny. That\\'s it;it\\'s really f-king funny. Sasha is a beast.,Hes still irrelevant and honestly alot of these people he treated this way lost their jobs after he conned them.,Going into this as a huge fan of the first one. I thought it would be a big let down but to my surprise it was on par with first one. While I do still like the first one a bit more. I liked the story and where they took Borat\\'s character. Adding his daughter into the mix was hilarious and where they go with it I didn\\'t see coming especially with Borat\\'s character. Although a lot more this time around is scripted the non- scripted parts are still great but are no where near as close to the first. Although the moment with a political figure I don\\'t see how that figure will comeback from this. All in all I was surprised with final film really funny while not topping the first I think IMO its not to far behind the first easy 8/10. Also shout out to amazon for releasing it early.,I loved the first Borat film and the sketches from Da Ali G show; but I don\\'t feel the same about this movie. The first Borat movie had me in stitches throughout the whole film; this one didn\\'t. There were parts that were funny; but there were also parts that weren\\'t and kinda felt like the same joke gets dragged on.,Very funny and entertaining. Love the Borat Film the first time and this time it was just as good and definitely lived up to my expectations. Just love Sacha Baron Cohen.,It is as good as the first movie; possibly better! It was the funniest movie I\\'ve seen in ages; and it was exactly what I needed during this dark time in world history.There are 2 kinds of people in this world. There are people who actually have a sense of humor; and will find this crazy; insanely funny.Then there are people with no sense of humor.It is as simple as that!,Sacha Baron Cohen is in fine form and Maria Bakalova is a discovery. The two provide an uncommon depth to the movie--two people brainwashed by a nationalistic; puritanical regime (sound familiar?) realizing the truth. The faux abortion sequence is hilarious. And their learning the truths shows people can learn from their mistakes and become better people. MAGA folk; not known for their sense of humor will be offended but most people will have more than a few laughs.,Made this 2020 less miserable. I adore Sacha\\'s humor. This is a masterpiece. Worth watching.,The film was so mediocre that both me and my companion predicted that he must have gotten somebody in an awkward position after 20 minutes of movie time; in fact it\\'s almost as if the whole film is structured around that one Rudy scene. In theory it\\'s interesting that you catch a politician in an awkward position and instead of just releasing a the clip; you make a whole film around it. But in practice; the whole film is a chore; full of cringe and not funny moments. Sacha is clearly just a leftist who is triggered by Trump; and while this isn\\'t a problem in itself; it\\'s quite clear he can\\'t express this in a very creative way; probably the worse thing he has made to date. It also seems to me that unlike the original Borat; a much higher proportion of people in the film are actors; and this kills a lot of the humor. I find it really quite strange that so many people revere who thrives on mocking humiliating people after lying and manipulating them to be in awkward position; at the very least it seemed like the harm was bounded when it wasn\\'t political.,Funny; silly; but wow; he gets those messages of truths out there; to the naive; Mainstream media swallowing masses; like the stuff about the PLandemic; vaccines; and how a \\'certain nation\\' control the media; and the USA banking cartels!,There were no funny bits in this disgusting movie; and not in any way would I recommend it,Firstly WHY??? There was no need for a second movie. The first one was great; so innovative and so damn funny. This second one sorry just doesn\\'t cut it. I think Cohen is relying too much on shock value rather than being genuinely clever and funny.There are some shocking moments again pushing the envelope but that\\'s exactly what he wants obviously and that will get more viewers and raise publicity.I didn\\'t laugh once.The daughter premise wasn\\'t convincing although the actor was great the storyline was almost like she was an added extra and the awkward moments together didn\\'t really work.Please don\\'t make a third!,I watched Borat I; interesting. A dictator; too. This; I don\\'t know how to define. One of the worst movies of 2020; and there were some really bad ones.,Not as funny as Borat 1 or Bruno even his America Tv Show.Only part worth it is the Giuliani prank. The rest of the movie is not that good or funny.The actress who play his daughter is very funny.Honestly if you manage to just see the Giuliani clip online the whole movie isn\\'t worth it.,I was excite. It was exactly what I expected. Good time. Very nice.,A genius display of current events.\\nDont expect everyone to like this; if you know what I mean :),I think many scenes were too short. They had more footage but for some reason many scenes were like cut in half. Also some seemed to be totally pointless and added nothing to the movie. The editing was just awful.The girl felt more natural to me. I don\\'t say it was acting as it was not. Anybody can go out and do this; but only they do it. The people they interacted with felt like they were just bad actors. Especially the doctor.It was fun overall. The jewish and the singing part just killed me.,They did this movie only for the elections. They attack Trump all time. The first one was different because they did a critique in different sectors. It\\'s clear this is a anti Trum political movie.,Whilst it had some funny moments was not nearly as good as the first one and was EXTREMELY political with the timing of the release definitely not a coincidence - if as much time was spent on making a funny movie instead of promoting the democrats party by bagging out the republicans I\\'m sure it could have been hilarious however Hollywood with it\\'s left wing agenda it was never going to be that way,Not nearly as clever or funny as the first one. The singing at the hillbilly rally was funny but nothing else really.,Meh like three chuckles during the whole movie too political.,Couldn\\'t wait to watch this and was not disappointed. Such a fan. At last a really entertaining film during this difficult time. Such a relief. He is such an amazing comedian. Very original; no one else even gets close. Very near the mark; snowflakes need not apply ha ha.,I liked The Dictator and the first Borat movie but this instalment is simply vulgar.Cohen is a talented comedian but fails to be one in this film. Rather than be witty he makes the most base jokes employing stereotypes that become stale almost immediately.I would like to see Cohen produce a film like Lost in Translation but maybe he is not capable.,Not even close to first Borat. Too much politics identity in this one...2 or 3 times I laugh. First 40-50 min looks lika a lifetime; not funny at all...,Borat is back. This sequel is good but just not like the first one. There a definitely some funny parts; but I found myself cringing and looking away for a lot of the movie. Very political as well.,This was a chore to finish watching! I feel sorry for this guy! This character is all he can do? It\\'s not even funny anymore just stupid! I\\'m glad I didn\\'t pay to see this.\\nTotal waste of time!,I watched it. I thought it was funny at times; but it pales in comparison to the masterpiece that was the first film.The mocumentary aspect of the first film is completely lost here; and it is just a structured movie like Bruno was.Bottom line; if this was about Joe Biden the critics would be giving it 5/10\\'s as well. The only reason it is getting \"rave\" reviews is because it is about Donald Trump and those that associate with the Republican party.Is it worth a watch? Sure. I was entertained but outside of that it is one time watch for me.,It was the movie we needed right now. It had a lot of heart and was different from the first Borat film but none the less great!,I found the first 20 minutes funny. The rest was a bit forced. Trouble is that Borat is quite recognisable these days so you lose the illusion that it is not staged even though everything is... And that is a big problem with this film for me as it\\'s just too bogus.,I dont think so many people in the US and A would be so offended by this movie. Last 4 years just proved that Americans tolerate differences to a point it gets All of us to laugh over the stupidity.I loved the movie.,I thought it was a strong movie for Baron-Cohen fans and the left will love it and be frustrated by it in equal measures. Still lots of laugh out loud moments and a couple of very potent cringe scenes. There were also a couple of scenes of genuine humanity to balance it out that I found the first movie lacked.Maria Bakalova completely steals every scene she is in and is an absolute treasure. I expect big things from her in the future.,I enjoyed this film but it was never going to have the same belly laughter as the first one. Much more scripted and forced.That said; it was still fun to watch. Sacha Baron Cohen never disappoints. The actress who plays his daughter did very well too.It was more like a buddy comedy than the original film which is in its own league,This was very funny. You know what to expect going in. I laughed many times. I\\'d recommend this.,There is nothing that produces even a chuckle. I only got through 45 minutes of this limp duck. The scenes are dragged out way too long and their premise is unimaginative. The fax \\'sup\\' gag borders on torture. The monkey bit; really? I think the monkey is the only one laughing because it got out of the movie early.\\nThis whole movie should have been a 5 minute skit on SNL; which is equally unfunny.\\nThis seems to be only a vehicle for Cohen to wear disguises and boor people with no wit.\\nMaybe it got funny after 45 minutes but I won\\'t be back to find out.\\nI gave it a two just for getting the movie produced in times of covid.,People; don\\'t waste your time watching this movie becouse it will be one bad decision; you will regret; I just lost twoo hour\\'s from my life.\\nI never even see a movie so badly made; actor\\'s; etc.\\nWhy the hell this Director Mister Jason Woliner\\nwill connect Kazakhstan with gipsy and romanian language; plus de virus Covit19. Only to a person that is has no brain will try to put something like this intro a movie. How this stupid movie even get financed...!!!This is absolutely shocking,While there are a few laughs to be had in this concoction; the disgusting attempts at gross out shocks are not funny or clever or nice. Getting an actress to portray a fifteen year old girl doing a dance at a debutantes ball in which she lifts up her skirt to expose her menstrual bleeding crotch in front of stunned legitimate ball attenders is sick. If Sacha Baron Cohen is trying to satirise himself it might just pass; but as an expose of anyone else it fails miserably. Yuck!,Half of the comedy in this is great; half tasteless; stupid and not funny. However that\\'s just me. To others it might be the opposite. Whoever you are; you\\'ll get a laugh or two out of it. The actor playing his daughter; I hope she gets a bag load of work offers now. She is a good performer.Rudolph Giuliani made an appearance.\\nI think it\\'s time to look up what the fallout has been on that one!,This movie was pathetic. Tons of dirty kindergarden level jokes. Just disgusting. Borat 1 was very funny; it used dark perverted jokes time to time to boost the feel of awkwardness and it felt very natural. Here it feels so forced and fake as if they tried to make it the cringest and most awkward movie ever. I\\'ll admit laughed a bit twice or trice; but as a whole experience it was a torture to watch; I\\'m even embarrassed to admit I\\'ve made it though the whole film.,I stupidly had low expectations on this one. It was hard to believe that a Borat sequel could live up to the first but I was not disappointed. So funny. So original. He\\'s still a comedic genius and you need to watch this film,What a return indeed!Such a great actor in my opinion; I was rolling with laughter!! It had those cringy yet hilarious moments in it that make you laugh out loud.I really appreciate how they portrayed it in such a way as to send a message which is in between the lines so to speak. That truth comes first; and through the spontaneous hilarious outbursts of Borat such secretive \\'hush-hush\\' information is exposed to the public in a manner of ridicule! I enjoyed this one a bit more than the first one for sure!!Definitely deserves a 10/10 from me!!! Great job!!,Complete waste of time; terrible. Liberal tripe. Struggled to watch it all and stay awake; took 3 attempts 8n the hope it might improve; it did not.,It wasn\\'t funny at all. He talks in Hebrew. What\\'s suppose to be funny was disgusting. Don\\'t waste your time!,I laughed a few times; it was OK. First one was much better. The politics were too much; and pretty exaggerated. If your swing far left; sure you\\'ll think it\\'s funny; they\\'ll laugh at any joke if it\\'s making fun of Republicans.,Sachs Baron Cohen is back as the legend Borat. It is offensive; crude but utterly hilarious especially the scene with his daughter after she swallows a baby on a cake; he takes to see if someone can take the baby out of her; after he says it was his fault the baby is in her\\nThis is an upgrade on the last movie,The introduction of the daughter made this sequel terrific. Fast paced with some classic scenes that would sit well within any episode of South Park. As funny as it could possibly get; this a sequel that comfortably matches the first movie,Sequel to 2006\\'s infamous phenomenon Borat; Sacha Baron Cohen returns to his iconic character to shine a light on U.S. politics. You will either be rolling on the floor in laughter throughout or cringing until well after the credits roll. Not an easy moviefilm to recommend to just anyone; but if you enjoyed the first Borat; you will find plenty of laughs here.,Sadly; (and conveniently) released before America heads to the polls; this was nothing but a smear campaign at certain political figures/parties.\\nAnd; although it was funny at times; SBC\\'s Borat character is washed up and just not as hilarious as he once was. Probably because everyone knows what to expect from Borat; taking the original Ali G/Bruno style comedy out of it.\\nIt\\'s worth a watch if you\\'re a fan of Cohen\\'s. However; if you\\'re easily offended by dick and ball jokes; frequent images of male genitalia and anti-semitc banter; sit this one out as you\\'ll just go all Ken and Karen.,1) Has enough comedic moments. The female lead is quite refreshing & saves this film.\\n2) Doesn\\'t take a single shot at the opposite side of the political spectrum. The current hyperprogressive hysteria has limitless potential for effective satire and would have actually been contrarian/edgy but Mr Cohen is actually more Bruno than Borat in real life.\\n3) The infamous Rudy Guiliani scene has some weird repetitive cuts from diffferent angles to make it seem like it\\'s gone on for longer than it does. Whatever it is; it\\'s certainly interesting and you\\'ve gotta give it to SBC for his rather unique brand of shock humor albeit point #2 sets this film back a few significant notches.,Yes some parts are extreme and annoying. But it\\'s entertaining and funny,This would have been a masterpiece if it wasn\\'t clearly politically biased.\\nIf only this had mocked the other side just a little bit; it would have made it a great watch.\\nEven the release date is intended to make it a democrat propaganda material.,I loved the first one. New ideas; new takes on comedy; greatly timed jokes. This one was cringeworthy at best. I grinned once; that\\'s it. Nothing new; just the same old recipe from the previous film - this time spiced with embarrassment. I respect Sacha Baron Cohen. I think his earlier work such as Ali G; Borat; Brüno and The Dictator has been great fun; but this is swing-and-a-miss. I don\\'t see the point of it.\\nA waste of talent; a waste of time and a waste of money. I sincerely hope; he will create something applicable to his talent in the future. This is a mark on his otherwise great comedic competence and reputation.,I loved Cohen\\'s earlier work (Ali G; Borat; Bruno); but this fell way short. The move doesn\\'t have the same feel as his earlier works and I can\\'t say that I laughed a single time during the movie.,As always SBC finds a way for satire without being too heavy handed in directly insulting people. Maria is incredible in her role and can easily hold her own with Sasha which says A LOT!\\nFor me the ending was my favorite part.\\nAnd bad boy Mr. Giuliani! 😂🤣,The best movie I\\'ve seen this year. a great criticism of reality; especially the American way of life and its politicians. I\\'m surprised all those Trump supporters don\\'t give it low marks.,Anyone going into this thinking it wasn\\'t a political movie needs to go watch the Princess Diaries.Well done Baron Cohen; well done on another incredible movie highlighting racism and prejudice.Highly recommend it as it\\'s just 1 1/2 hrs of bonkers by Baron Cohen,I laughed out loud at a handful of scenes. I laugh easily at this type of humor; and I know this.\\nI definitely felt uncomfortable; though; with that last interview. It probably goes too far. I cringed.\\nI get it; there are parts of this country that don\\'t share the same views as the coasts. Some are downright scary when looked at with an evolved sense of humanity. But; to search them out and use them as a representation of a whole party is just flat wrong. You can do this for any group. I wish this movie was more fair and less focused on our politics here. Had these stunts been attempted on all people of varying ideologies you would have had the same results. There are plenty of gullible and flawed people from the diverse spectrum of beliefs out there.\\nI think SBC is better than this but still a comedic genius.,Sequels are never the best; but this one is topping the charts Tutar is simply amazing it cannot get any better than this,What if you continued to belittle half your audience and pandered to less than half of the remainder? maybe boycotting all \" entertainment \" since 2016 is not a bad idea,I wasted 90 minutes watching this totally amateurish movie. Total waste of time. I guess if you thought the first movie was a 10; this will get a 5; so if you thought the first was a 5; this is a zero!\\nDon\\'t waste a minute of your life watching this.,This is what happens when the first movie is a huge success; took much pressure on the second and yes it\\'s a flop!They try to hard to make it funny; Borats jokes and timings are poor!First movie was a documentary style movie; this feels like a normal movie with a story which could be ok; but the acting and punchy jokes were missing.Sometimes just leave movies as they are and don\\'t try and take advantage of all the hype,This film appears to have been made for the sole purpose of trying to influence the American election. It only goes after Trump supporters. I enjoyed the first Borat movie; but as everyone know about Borat now; it\\'s obvious most scenes were scripted and not actual pranks. The movie comes off as racist and arrogant; while trying to appear that the movie is against racism and pushing diversity.,Film was funny. Really disappointed with Tom Hank\\'s performance; though. You could tell his heart was never really in it. He left a lot to be desired. Tom\\'s performance falls somewhere between Angels and Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016). Thomas is a rare taken; indeed; however his shortcomings were truly on display during this cinematic performance. All in and all; 7/10 stars.Oh and Rudy Giuliani touches himself at the end.,Borat saves 2020 and the comedy genre! If you liked the first movie; you will love this one!,It\\'s tough for this movie to live up to the hype of the original which I loved so much but it does a pretty good job. I laughed so hard at times i thought I couldn\\'t breathe. And there were moments of compassion that I wasn\\'t expecting which gave some depth to the movie. Really great and definitely worth the watch. I mean Sacha is a genius and it was a masterpiece,Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was a worthy follow up to a first film and i can say that i am glad that this film didnt hold nothing back and it still keeped same style of humor that will offend many people ;but who cares about them;let them cry a river somewhere in a corner of their basements room.Sacha was great again as Borat and he keeped his style through entire film.His daughter was also very funny and she was a great addition to this film;she and Borat shared a lot of great moments together in which one they made fun of everything starting with politicians ;virus and other staff.Borat Subsequent Moviefilm was very funny film to me;not on level of first but still very good,Funny movie. Some people say not funny like first one. You make movie in pandemic; then you allowed to judge. Perfect moviefilm to help swallow load of 2020! Very Nice!,Most of the movie was scripted unlike the the first one. Real reactions made the first movie so great and this one didnt have that feeling.,Wow. Just as good as the first. Love the relationship between borat and his daughter. Such great chemistry equals so many laughs,It seems 2020 is going to be the year of watching movies at home; so this is my first \\'home movie\\' review. One of the great things about comedies at the cinema is that you can hear what everyone else thinks of the movie. This is especially the case with a movie like Borat where some of the comedy is very subtle.Anyway overall the second Borat movie is an entertaining watch. At times you do wonder how politically correct some of the humour is; but comedy should push these boundaries. I suppose the stand out moment of the movie is the Rudy Giuliani scene which has got a lot of publicity. I\\'m sure this will have boosted the viewing figures and it doesn\\'t look good. It seems his days of being regarded as one of the hero\\'s of 9/11 are long behind.Whatever your thoughts are on the original Borat film you\\'re pretty certain to feel the same way about this movie.,The first Borat is a timeless classic; you can watch that any time and laugh at the top class satire.\\nBut this one is more of a comedy movie with great laughs here and there; but overall it\\'s just a one time movie with almost no added value for it\\'s social commentary or satire.\\nStill a good movie though.,Haha. Uses deception and misinformation to sway an election. Nice...Just like Russia as the left wing cried. I\\'m not even a Trumpet/GOP fan; but he makes his left wing bias noticeable. His Bias is real to see; and I\\'m a registered independent. Borat is just a washed up Democrat hack now. Other then that. Movie was decent; but not like past before his left wing bias showed. He\\'ll be washed up for a couple years; then you\\'ll probably see another political hit job to rally cry his base. That\\'s what crony capitalism is about. They will all suffer now; since trump bashing won\\'t buy them clicks.,This was never going to be as good as the first one and SBC knows this as he addresses early on in the film that he would need a disguise as the character Borat is to well known to walk arould pranking the unsuspecting public. This is were his daughter ( Maria Bakalova ) comes in to play producing a sterling performance; matching her dad for cringe factor and showing that she has balls as big as SBC.It may not be the best film but In these crazy and sad times an hour and a half of Borat is just what the doctor ordered.,After massive laugh attack of first Borat which imho was great; this second installment feels forced and unfunny from the get go. Storyline is rubbish; acting is bad and it all feels just so hastily glued that we found it to be tiring and barely funny at any point. At somepoint you forgot thinking if this or that scene was completely acted because it did not make you laugh regardless. There was of course the added weight of the political agenda that further made it feel tiring and forced effort. One of the worst movies I have seen in last 10 years.,Genius - a proper laugh and not a disappointment in any way.,Sacha never fails to make you laugh or amaze. He\\'s done it again here. Basically he trolled people and made a movie out of it showing true reactions and candid moments of it. And Maria baklova was an amazing edition here. Even though i wasn\\'t sure anyone could match his spirit of character play which he takes it to extreme ways (which he did in this movie) she could do that too. In the recent interview sacha talked about choosing her from 500 candidates and she was given the script in UK and she has never been to US before yet did a mind-blowing job in the movie with her flawless acting and sacha was actually overshadowed by her performance which is crazy. If she doesn\\'t get an Oscar it\\'s gonna be a shame. Overall controversial and extremely funny and genuine documentary like movie.,I can watch a horror movie almost without flinching because I know it\\'s not real. I can appreciate the art of it. But with this movie; nope. I cover my eyes as I see some of the REAL events unfold in front of me. I\\'m laughing but I\\'m horrified at the same time. How these guys pull off why they do takes courage. ALLOT of courage.,The appeal of this movie is the real moments that our characters find themselves in. This movie; as opposed to the first; actually had a story arc for Borat\\'s daughter that is actually quite compelling at times. The shenanigans that come out of this movie are on point for a SBC flick. Though I will say the viral scene with Rudy G. Is not as controversial as social media might claim.,I love Borat 1 and was extremely excited when they announced a second one but I was left disappointed. The jokes weren\\'t on the same level as the first one and it felt like less risks were taken when filming daring scene for one joke. I think one of the main reasons for the downfall of this movie is that there was no Azamat as he was turned into a coach. The story was also really boring and wasn\\'t nearly as stupid or exciting as the first movies. Borat should have gone to another country to learn from them instead of going back to America.,Favorite part: Babysitter Jeanise. Other than that; this movie didn\\'t make me laugh and cringe like the first one did. My reaction to the movie was further solidified by the second-hand embarrassment I felt for Cohen in his interviews and how out of touch he is.,Borat could have been much much better; it was like he was repeated the same jokes again and again; could have been much much better.,I love SCB; he is genius. But I found here he is trying to do some silly comedy. Always trying to be funny dragging unnecessary pervert activity. Felt disturb. Anyway the sarcasm was funny; enjoyed.,This is Borat 2. If you didn\\'t get the humor of the first Borat movie you won\\'t get it here either so don\\'t bother watching or reviewing this. Like the first one; this movie had me laughing at the over-the-top portrayal of a backwards man from a backwards country with a lot of stupid sex jokes and shock-material. I also laughed at the all-to-real backwards Americans with the understanding that a lot of what we are seeing is very cleverly edited to make the dupes seem even more ridiculous. If you read interviews of the dupes from the first movie you realize that all is not as it seems. Hours worth of footage is presented as minute-long encounters in which people say really stupid things or appear to agree with Borat on some very risque subjects. So; TAKE IT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT! I\\'m sure that we\\'ll hear more stories of how Sasha Baron Cohen and his crew deceived or otherwise bamboozled the people in the movie to act as they did; but we will most likely also conclude that fancy editing aside; some of those people really did say some pretty offensive things. For example; it really doesn\\'t matter how silly a song Borat was singing to the crowd of Texans to make them all look like imbecilic conspiracy theorists; the guy who throws a Nazi salute up is an over-the-top moron.\\nLike the first movie; this one had too many scenes that seem too contrived and a stretch of the imagination in order to shock or get laughs. Some of it just wasn\\'t all that funny to me; but it had plenty of laughs otherwise. All-in-all; it was entertaining and I watched it for free thanks to Amazon Prime.\\nBut wait -- there\\'s more! I have to take issue with the way that the media; Cohen and the production company have portrayed Rudy Giuliani here. I admit that I was a Rudy fan when I lived in New York and was very impressed with the way he conducted himself on 9/11; but I think he\\'s lost his mind with age and has become nothing short of a hand-puppet for the most (the hugist) imbecilic conspiracy theorist; McDonald Trump. That said; I felt manipulated by the footage of Rudy and had to rewind it several times to try to align what I saw with what I read in the press. CNN and the New York Times would have us believe that he was caught making sexy time (or trying to) with Borat\\'s daughter. What I saw was him stupidly agreeing to finish the interview in the bedroom with an attractive; much younger woman and being a bit touchy-feely (patting her on her hip). What I also saw was a quick shot of him trying to get her hair or microphone or something out of a button or zipper on the top of her dress. It appears that we are missing the lead-up to this; like; perhaps; her asking for him to help her get unstuck) making it even more likely that it was edited to make it look like he was unbuttoning her to get her undressed. The press made a very big deal about him laying on the bed putting his hands down his pants ostensibly to touch his penis. What I saw was her taking his microphone unit from the waist of his pants (you can see it in her hand as she lifts her hands from his pants) and then he lays back to tuck his shirt back in; anyone else who is a bit overweight with a larger belly knows that this is an efficient way to get tucked back in. I understand that the Trump administration is a bunch of ass-clowns just asking to be made fun of; but let\\'s at least show the real stupidity of these people without resorting to the very type of fakery that the conspiracy theorists point to as proof that the holocaust never occurred. And stop feeding the extreme left-wing nut-jobs at CNN and the New York Times.,Started with too much excitement but found it disappointing.\\nExcept the daughter\\'s rule book concept; nothing else was funny. The climax was fine but it felt too stretched.,I am a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s previous work as borat and Ali G. It was daring and hilarious because he exposed people in a clever way by pretending to be much dumber than he is.\\nHowever; borat 2 was not a \"great success\" according to me.As soon I saw the trailer; I was both excited but concerned about the casting of his female co star. She did not change my mind since she was came across as annoying and ruined most of the scenes she was in. Also; it seemed she aimed for the ideology; that weird faces and loud noises equals funny. Instead she made it cringe worhty and at times i even had to skip her bits talking in the movie.Sacha Baron Cohen did a better performance; although at many times; he seemed off character such as the rally gig. There were also other times like the mike pence scene where he acts completely different. Therefore; the idea of disguising a disguised person did not work out in this case. I laughed perhaps at 3 occasions throughout the movie which was only Sacha\\'s single scenes.The scripted parts in the movie were terrible and Sacha should have focused on funny pranks instead of monotonous dialogues with Borat\\'s daughter. At times; I felt like I was watching a movie aimed for kids. For example; the ending made was cringe worthy and the combination of vulgarity and childish script gave was terrible.Also; the one sided political aspect of this movie was disappointing. This movie will be irrelevant in five years since its main purpose seemed to focus on the election.,Plot: a Californian with net worth $160m taking pleasure in humiliating peopleThis movie is mostly propaganda focusing on current events and will be forgotten five minutes after the election.,Was amazing seeing the world through the eyes of a woke far left liberal loony; they tried so hard to paint the people who love america as bad but just ended up making them look as mentally unstable as borat! LOL,The movie was terrible. He clearly doesn\\'t have the clout in America anymore; the scenes were chopped up very poorly and the narrative storyline they tried didn\\'t work at all. He really didn\\'t get anyone to say anything provocative or interesting. Clearly many of the scenes are manipulated and forced. Probably his worst film to date. He didn\\'t make any statements about America that are new or reveal anything we don\\'t already know. His interviews sucked and the film was mostly Borat and his \"daughter\" and some guy at a copy machine store. Sacha you have fallen. At least you asked people to get out and vote!,I thought it was funny enough. That scene where he and his daughter were dancing for \"higher society\".... omg my jaw hit the floor and I was peeking out behind hands that covered my eye\\'s.... The ending was an obvious lay down of cards in where Cohen stands politically though. That was a let down. A good 4/10 from me. Not essential viewing; but worth a look in if you\\'re bored.,Too much Kazakh and reading subtitles. Super political. He should have stopped at Bruno.,I don\\'t know what the point of this movie was; I missed the good ol Borat who wasn\\'t afraid to bash anybody; this seemed like a desperate attempt to \\'play it safe\\' but actually; I think this was the end of Borat. I personally prefer the first one; instead of this crap.,There were some funny moments but the movie as a whole wasn\\'t nearly as funny as the first. The basic story takes what would\\'ve been a few jokes about the mistreatment of women in Borat\\'s country previously and makes it a running gag that goes ridiculously far with it. Relies too much on gross out humor. Hard to watch at times. It wasn\\'t even that successful in political figure-damning. At least not how I expected it to be. Not really quotable or re-watchable.,This actor or whatever he is is totally repulsive.,It\\'s ubiquitous that most people are aware of Sacha Baron Cohen and his satire these days.It\\'s been 14 years since the original one and 11 years since Bruno. This satire gets tiresome and cringe once people are aware of the joke and realise in the edit that most of it is not real. It doesn\\'t seem as edgy as the original either. I wanted to like it; but it just wasn\\'t for me. Only an opinion for what it\\'s worth.I give 4/10 for his previous better work like Ali G..,Humour is subjective. However it\\'s arguable that depravity; offence-causing and general crassness requires very little comedic skill. Nothing new was bought to the table here except very obvious political leanings and a quest to belittle those whose views differ. I say this as someone who has very little interest in politics in general; so I don\\'t have a viewpoint or dogma to defend. I just think there should be balance in everything; especially if art is a vehicle through which society can heal. That\\'s why Bill Burr is such a legend as he mocks everyone!,No this was anything but Borat. It starts off at a vulgar tone and ends with the same. I had to skip many parts due to this. It was painful to watch. This was a political satire done in worst possible way. If you were looking for comedy; forget about it; all you are going to get is watching pubic hairs and butt *oles. There\\'s hardly anything of note. A movie done in haste. In fact seems no real effort was put in.\\nDisappointed,Offensive\\nDisrespect for beliefs (this is not a critique)\\nRepeating jokes from 14 years ago\\nYes; this is not a comedy!\\nThe propaganda of the left wing and the Democrats and its publication a few days before the US elections\\nAlas; the talents serve the political factions,Gave it a 10 just to even out all the bad reviews from the Trump worshipers. It is a very funny movie For opened minded people! If you are a Trump lover you probably should just skip it along with 99% of all movies due to the fact nobody relevant in Hollywood supports him. Also it\\'s hard not to compare to the first one but try to.,As most sequels; this one is lacking that touch of originality. The actress playing his daughter Tutar is good. Borat is not always convincing but there are several funny and many cringeworthy scenes. Unfortunately; the scenes with Pence and Giuliani did not work and not funny. Overall; a mediocre export from Kazakhstan.,As my review title says it is kind of feast or famine with Borat 2. Some of the pranks were great; but some were just plain not funny. Without giving spoilers it\\'s hard to describe. The only thing I will say is the o e that was leaked about Rudy was creepy; but clearly he was tucking his shirt after taking off the mic. If anyone say anything different you are a dope. The first movie was revolutionary the second one was not.,Looks terrible and I only watched the trailer first one was good this is desperate and so bad looking,Whoever says this one isn\\'t better than the first clearly got lost. It\\'s just masterful how Sacha was able to pull this off being that everyone knows him; there was a pandemic and shutdown. And the cherry on all of this was Rudy Giuliani who didn\\'t know about his involvement to the film until the very week it was released. Also he made himself look extremely creepier than usual. The female actress was a true rock star. Yes this was better than the first one. 10/10,Great to see the character return but this film was poorly executed and only had a couple of funny moments.,I laughed for an hour and a half and now my cheeks hurt. A similar taste to Cohen\\'s previous movies; but perhaps with a more sober tone towards the end. And more so as the credits ended.,This is a very irreverent movie on many levels; people who enjoy irreverent movies will generally love this one because of the inventiveness. Unless you are a Trump fan.There is a made-up reason for Borat\\'s mission to the USA; to deliver his 15-yr-old daughter as a bride; in the end he realizes he was sent there to spread the virus that caused COVID-19. He and his daughter (actress actually about 23 during production) run a series of scams; perhaps the most interesting with Rudy Giuliani in a hotel room because it currently (Oct 2020) is making the rounds in various news outlets. He was taken in totally by the scam of being interviewed by a cute; inexperienced foreign reporter; touching her affectionately; afterwards going to the bedroom for a drink; then appearing to pleasure himself with his hand down his pants. But probably just tucking his shirt in; as he claims. It is very funny if you are not on the receiving end of the joke.Anyway overall I found it to be a well made and very funny movie; mostly making fun of Trump and his supporters. If I were a Trump fan I\\'d likely react very differently. I watched it on Amazon streaming via my Roku.,It\\'s not as good as the 1st but still good. There were a few parts that I thought were poor and not funny but a fair few parts had me howling. 6.5/10,It\\'s not as good as the first one; but still really enjoyable and funny. And the twist at the end is just brilliant. ^^,Lame; boring; stupid and disgusting. Will rot your mind and make you stupider than Tweety.,Utterly brilliant film. The first film had such a great impact and managed to fool so many people you\\'d think that he wouldn\\'t be able to do it again; but he did. Had me in hysterics most of the time. Its so clever how he manages to convince so many Americans to believe the act.\\nSacha baron Cohen is a master,Sacha is an absolute legend..he pulled it off again; but just better,This movie was better than the other one. The jokes are out of the doubt. I can\\'t say he made me laugh too much; though.,It blew. I tried. I watched it with an open mind. Didn\\'t work. Watched it again with an altered mind. Still....nada.....and I think Kevin Smith movies are masterpieces and Broken Lizard films are Oscar-worthy. That\\'s how badly this steaming pile of a diaper fire is.It\\'ll probably go down in history as the biggest cult classic since Reefer Madness.I\\'d ask for my money back but it was part of my subscription.,If borat didn\\'t have TDS in the first movie it\\'s clearly got stage 4 TDS now.,The charm of the first movie was that you could never tell when people were in on the joke or genuine candid people. This movie had maybe one good moment like that; but never really hit the sweet spot. None of the jokes really hit like the first one. It felt lazy and forced. yay it\\'s fun to make fun of republicans I guess; but you have to at least make it funny. The movie literally ends this \"Go vote\" if that tells you the reason this movie was made and released when it was. Spoiler alert: it wasn\\'t for fans who\\'ve been excited for another Borat movie for years.\\nCost me $0 to watch and still wasn\\'t worth it.,Borat is back ! This may not pack the punch of the first movie; but it sure does deliver on its topical message told through Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s very unique comedy style.\\nNot for the faint hearted; it will almost certainly offend the intellectually challenged Gun Totin\\' Conservative Americans; Evangelicals; etc...........This is; in essence; a sharp parody of all thats been bad in America for the past few years.I found it hilarious.,Reason for 1 rating (lowest) - I think the way they portrayed a 15 year old girl and the exposure is in very poor taste in the name of comedy. Not worth the watch.,This is a disgusting movie with blasphemy. The movie started a bit funny and it touches politics way too much. Its It\\'s actually all about politics. They played around with a very sensitive topic which is abortion in a very unsensitive; disgusting way. This film is a punch in the stomach for all women. Is just disgusting. My husband and I we decided to stop watching the movie in the scene where the girl is dancing and her dress is all cover in blood due to her menstruation. An absolute disgusting scene that seriously should be prohibited.,Some funny scenes but all in all just an eh. This guy needs to just go away already. But when you are in the \"club\"; you are in the club and once in the club one can continue to suck for a while and still make movies.,Sacha you have done it again!! The icing on the cake for me was Guiliani\\'s October surprise,More than half the skits were fake.; Borat is the only funny guy in the whole movie and he is not as good as he was in the first one because everyone knows him in the US.; I love the first one but this one has no rewatch value and it\\'s just disgusting.,Unntural foreign garbage.You think it\\'s funny that we live for our country; guns ans country? Then the joke\\'s on you. A relation between a father and a daughter is their affair and protected by the constitution. So there.\\nHail President Trump.,I watched it free to air on Solar Movies website (where you can watch tens of thousands of movies for free).. Compared to the first movie; this one was very tame. I do not regret watching it; I found it entertaining; but I found it slow and really lacking in humor.In reality; no way could Sacha Baron Cohen repeat the earlier classic and certainly not expect it to be better;. The shock factor is long gone.I really considered this one as mediocre.,The second part has some funny moments but cannot reach the level of the first one. Maybe because people already have high expectations and also due to some repetitions. Overall; it is a fun movie to watch (not many funny movies coming lately from Hollywood).but it somewhat more predictable.,I think no one should stoop to such a low level of making a movie like this. It\\'s a scripted and professionally filmed movie that supports a few scenes designed to shock you and \\'uncover\\' something about others.\\nIn reality; what happens is that Borat exploits other people\\'s friendliness; openness and patience while insulting them with pubertal humor; having a camera crew in the bushes hoping for an improper reaction.\\nHe does tricks from his older content; such as showing up and identifying with a group of people;appearing foreign and well-meaning; but then twisting the content more and more towards very inappropriate. It was funny back then; but this time around almost no one got fooled or reacted to any of his jokes; even though he tried harder and harder to shock. And when making something like a self proclaimed political commentary; with interviews of real people in a false context; I don\\'t think this is an okay way of doing it. The \\'shocking\\' scene at the end was a beautiful woman talking about how starstruck she was; flirting with that Rudy guy; then pulling him into a bedroom. Then Borat comes in yelling that she was 15; when in fact she was 24; playing a serious adult role of reporter; nothing like the more childish daughter role of earlier in the movie. Like some episode of how to catch a predator. There wasn\\'t anything revealed there even. I don\\'t know; I think it\\'s tasteless and whatever story they are trying to serve it\\'s viewers I think most would find it counter-productive to that.,The first half is funny but gross-out cringey (and socially and politically no-holds barred). The second half is genius.,Sacha Baron Cohen has hilarious blown open the undeniable corruption of America\\'s currently politics and called out all those who are complicit with it. Never has anything so educational made me laugh so much.Please watch this - it\\'s message is so important. Not only are bad men undeniably exposed for who they really are; but a glimpse is given into the hope and the good that America could be.,Not as funny or charming as the first movie; but still better than anything else around at the moment. This time the target(s) of his humour are almost entirely Republicans and the right; which became a bit tiresome; though I\\'d love to know the full SP on the Giuliani scene. What really kept this film afloat was Borat\\'s daughter (Maria Bakalova ); she really owned the role and ran away with it; I don\\'t think I\\'ve been so impressed with a new actor in many years; she was fantastic I hope we see more from her soon.,Sasha Baron Cohen dusts off the grey suit for a second run as Borat Sagdiyev; fourteen years after the release of the first Borat film. If you saw the 2006 film you know what to expect; satire and social commentary turned up to 11. Cohen still employs his heavy-handed approach to making very nuanced comments on modern society; all wrapped in cringe-inducing humor. Seeing people agree with and feel emboldened by his use of stereotypes that create a safe space for bigotry and misogyny show the audience how prevalent hate still is in the world. Cohen again holds a mirror up to society and creates laughs for those already in on the truth.81/100,1st borat movie was very good and funny.\\n2nd borat movie a complete disaster to the point where my son 17 years old did not finish it.\\nNo where near as funny as the first borat\\nWhat a waist of money and energy really...,Borat again delivers comedy in very awkward situations as he exposes America in the most humorous way possible. A lot of shocking moments. Definitely worth the watch. It is not as good as the first one but definitely just as shocking.,Excellent. Breath of fresh air from PC nonsense that is typically made today. Extra stars just for having the courage to make this film in the current political climate,Honestly; I was so waiting to see this movie; but I must say that it was very weak compared to the previous version!,Kind of disappointing to read conservatives\\' ratings just calling the film juvenile and not funny. Did they just not get it? This is satire; and since there appears to be confusion somehow: Cohen does not hate Jews or women; or even the Q Anon guys he lived with for 5 days. He said they were simply good; normal people who had just been fed a diet of lies. He\\'s a good man and a funny one at that. Why are you so upset that bigotry and hate is being called out for what it is in this film?Just look no further than the current president if you want to criticize someone for being so morally bankrupt; a man who thinks he can grab women\\'s crotches whenever he wants. It\\'s a shame that any man would defend this twisted power trip.Giuliani is a creep; and it\\'s on tape. Like the president; he loves women laughably younger than him; and cheating on their spouses is just second nature to them (hm... seems pretty common with politicians in general; though. Hi; Bill; hello Mr. Weiner).But I really can\\'t understand defending this embarrassing president and trashing any movie that makes you feel like your supposed political sensibilities are offended. You know who\\'s not offended by this film? People who don\\'t identify as Nazis; and also people who understand what. satire. is. Borat is a character and does not reflect the actual views of Cohen... he is a vessel to expose anti-Semitism; racism; sexism; and so many things that hurt human beings.,To be honest; I\\'m not a fan of Cohen\\'s brand of comedy. That said; his past films exposed people in power for greed and racism. This time he pranked really good people; the kind babysitter; the Christian Counselor and the Jewish ladies. I thought that was in very poor taste.Frankly this film made me cringe so many times it was hard to watch. I know he\\'s going for shock value but it repulsed me.,Some funny scenes but not even close to as good as the original. Like a 16 year old wrote it. Lots of repetitive and corny jokes.,Much better then the first one. this one actually had some writers and a point to it. but still cringe and border idiotic. pathetic idea ; pathetic characters; cringe supreme.,I am a huge fan of the original Borat. I\\'ve seen it about 60 times. I had high hopes for this and it paid off. With 2020 being the worst year EVER; we needed a good movie to cheer everyone up. Borat did that and made us all get a good laugh. Not as good of the first; but no one was expecting it to be as good. To sum it up for everyone; WATCH THIS MOVIE. Watch it especially if you loved the first. 8.5/10,Borat 1 is classic; its well made with a story and most importantly it made me lauge. This one failed in every category. I would not recommend it to anyone.,Awful; meaningless; nasty; disgusting and terrible!! It is not funny at all. I am deeply sorry for the such meaningless script. I do not want to think more about this movie!,I really liked this part; it wasnt as good as the first one but it had a lot to say; YAKSHAMAY,I couldn\\'t bear watching more than half of it ; and it was the first time for me not to watch a movie to the end. Absolutely disgusting and aweful!,All I have to say in in the title. Sorry if this is too short.,Sacha Baron Cohen goes above and beyond to make his point and bring the truth forth and the timing couldn\\'t have been more perfect for this movie to come out.,Probably the most important political satire of our time. It\\'s bold; brutal and disheartening.,Karen killed Fauci.\\nNow go vote or you will be execute!,Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s best work yet.I haven\\'t laughed so loudly for a while.Whilst this is at times extremely uncomfortable viewing the message that he is sending is crystal clear and very much of the moment. Hilarious yet chilling at the same time.,Probably just as funny as the first one. Didn\\'t stops laughing the whole time. Not for tge squeamish though! 😂😂😂,After watching the 1st Part \"Borat\" over a decade ago; I always wanted a 2nd part and after 14 long years finally it is here. An amazing movie and not to be taken in a wrong way. It is just for fun.,Saha reminded me with Peter Sellers on his way of acting especially when he is descising; a little bit from the pink panther strikes back..\\nIts a nice movie to watch over all,Very funny as expected; though they took liberties with certain scenes.,I was hyped once I learned another Borat was coming out. I had seen the right rally concert leaked and thought it was hilarious; couldn\\'t wait to see the whole deal.The trailer also looked hilarious. Sadly the trailer basicly spoiled the whole movie as it had all the best jokes in it; the trailer even had stuff the movie didn\\'t. The right rally gig wasa big disappointment as the movie was more focused on the scripted plot than showing borat trolling Trump supporters. The leaked video filmed with a phone was miles better as it only shows borat singing.Do NOT watch the trailer and you might find the movie a lot funnier.,It was a good watch for the most part although it was just not near as funny as the original borat; the performance from sacha baron cohen wasn\\'t a good one in comparison to the original borat.You should watch it though its still decent but really not as good as the OG borat,I think I actually lost brain cells watching the first 20 minutes of this movie. One would have to have an EXTREMELY warped and demented sense of humor to enjoy this film.,I don\\'t know what high school deranged farm humour this is.A few chuckles here and there. Big waste of time.Might as well watch any schumer,This movie has so much comedy and heartwarming moments that it makes you forget to realise how amazing the films writers are that they were able to adapt so well to the current pandemic situation to give this movie even more of that tasty realism and make this a true Borat movie,Amazing work by Sacha and team; Maria looks pretty. All characters have given justice to their roles.,Yes I rated it a 10 to help offset the morons voting it a 1/10. But it\\'s truly a 7 for me. Classic Borat punch lines with some definite cringe moments;as expected. Nice little twist at the end. It was not as political as some reviews state. Yes there\\'s politics it\\'s pokes fun at both the left and right but it\\'s about the humour. Have to check it out if you\\'re a Borat fan!,Didn\\'t disappoint. It\\'s everything that we expected.,Big disappointment! After waiting 14 years the public and fans deserved better. The humor was weird like not meant to be funny but more for the shock factor. Very disappointed.,Considering the level of fame Sacha Baron Cohen and his characters have achieved it\\'s absolutely incredible that he was able to pull off something like this... Smart; hilarious and shockingly absurd.,I didn\\'t really think I was going to enjoy this Borat revival; but I was quietly optimistic; given the generally positive reviews circulating online. I have in hindsight realised that they were speaking well of this film not for the humour (which is crass and lazy for the most part); but for its political commentary on the current state of the USA. Despite this; Borat is still far from a good film; leaning on some terrible comedy and its reputation for commercial success.In a similar vein to its predecessor; Borat Subsequent Moviefilm is a film that mocks itself; belittling genders; races and personal beliefs over the meagre 1.5 hour runtime. I know this is the point; but it doesn\\'t make watching any easier: particular jokes (one aimed at the Jewish community and another based around female puberty) were actually painful to witness; getting more of an embarrassed response than anything else. Behind these set pieces were some legitimately clever moments and even some properly written gags; but it wouldn\\'t be worth sitting through the dreg to get to them.In spite of this; the clever aspect of Borat is in his unassuming nature. By being naive and clueless (and at times extremist in his views); he lulls Americans into a false sense of security; which allows some insightful moments. My personal favourites included managing to extricate a Nazi salute from a Republican voter; whilst another showed the brutally honest misogyny of a southern man at a Debutante Ball. There is technically a \"story\" to this film as well; but it\\'s a stretch to call it worth paying attention to. Something that really irked me was the excessive green-screening used: clearly the budget did not extend to sending the cast and crew all over the globe; but not even having the energy to build a low-budget set on-site just looks careless to me.All in all; Borat was not good. It wasn\\'t very clever; it wasn\\'t very funny; but more than anything; it didn\\'t tell me anything about the crazy parts of the USA I didn\\'t already know. In reality; you\\'d be better off watching the Youtube channel \"All Gas No Brakes\" - political humour; whilst leaving the crass jokes at the door.,What a sell out.Not funny; politically motivated; offensive to people who don\\'t deserve to be mocked,Movie would have been a great success without women partlcipatong in it. Rudy was made out to lool like a good guy; which he is not. Shame on you Sasha Baron Cohen. Oh how you have fallen since Ali G.,After working in the industry for so long Borat has become a very well known face. First Borat was released when social media and youtube wasnt really a thing. People didnt have smartphones. Today its much more difficult to make this movie without getting recorded by fanboys or strangers. I wasn\\'t really expecting it to be as great as first one but given current time it delivered everything that first movie had.It could be less scripted but to be honest that would be quite impossible in a time when everyone has a smartphone. I am surprised he was able to perform this well.I am not going to release any details but definitely worth watching.Watch it now!,Sacha Baron Cohen and the other girl who acted as his daughter have done a wonderful job. But Larry Charles could have done much better just like he entertained us with crude humor and offensive comedy as in the prequel of this film.,Sacha Baron Cohen revisits his most famous character in what feels like another in a long line of tired retread comedies. What was groundbreaking 15 years ago is now a tad uninspired. Sure; there are a handful of good chuckles... However; the main takeaway from this film is that the red half of America is one of the least educated (verging on mentally challenged) basket of deplorables in the world. But again... Everyone already knew that.,Same same same ... Shows the structural problems in the US; but a bit boring. Has a good ending.,Borat\\'s anticipated return was epic when I first learned of it! But I always knew it would never be as good as the original. I hoped it would at least be good; but I prepared for the worst. It had its moments; but overall was a let-down. There was way too much focus on Borat\\'s daughter. I didn\\'t watch this for her! I want to watch a Borat movie for the man himself! Would I recommend you watch this? Yes. But only if you have an hour and a half to spare and you don\\'t fancy watching anything else. Aside from that; don\\'t rush to see this,The film was not as side-splittingly hilarious as the first one; but perhaps that\\'s just because the ridiculousness of \"everyday Americans\" has already been so exposed in all forms of media that it is no longer shocking.Still a sharp satire with some funny moments; worth a watch.,Not as funny as original I think they waited to long fir a 2nd movie there was some laughs the whole movie no,Maybe i had 2 3 laughs but i already saw those moments on youtube so .. meh,This film has a few moments of comedy. Otherwise; it is pure Hollywood propaganda. I went into the film having seen the first; but knowing very little about the sequel. I should have used context clues to decipher the sole purpose of the film.... to influence voting. The film ends with the text \"now vote; or be executed\". This was strategically released a little over a week before the election in an attempt to sway public opinion. It failed. Even as a comedy; this film was full of old tropes and overplayed stereotypes. Watch at your own risk; but be prepared to be let down.Cohen succeeds at very little in this film. It is a reminder that he is a one trick pony and is more of an activist than an actor. Any acclaim for this film will be on purely political grounds. Hard pass.,The original was a classic but this is a poor sequel. The jokes aren\\'t as funny; the characters aren\\'t as strong; the whole thing comes across as desperate.\\nIn a couple of years people will admit that this movie sucks.,The very satirical and current nature of Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm is what makes it good. Republicans will be literally swearing at the TV.HOWEVER; this is counterbalanced with some overly contrived scenes; a little to heavy reliance on shock comedy moments and a bit of a pacing issue l; which is never a great sign for a film with such a short running time.I love Sacha Baren Cohen and most of his work; but this one felt like a step too far in the wrong direction to be anything more than a semi-watchable footnote in his Filmography in 3-5 years from now.,God did I need to laugh and I did. Especially loved the storyline spoofing patriarchal culture and Melania\\'s golden cage. The debutante ball punk couldn\\'t have been any funnier. And then there was the crashing of some kind of republican ladies\\' affair. Kudos to Borak\\'s costar who was superb!,Hilarious and brillant of you like dark Humor. A very good sequal to the Match changing first Borat Film of 2006.,Not quite as many shocking moments and more focus on the story compared to the first but the climate that Sacha has to do this in was insane with the virus going on. It\\'s hard not to look at the original with nostalgia but still pretty damn good.,The humour was not there this time around; everything was so predictable.,Borat and the girl did great. This puts a smile on my face. I am a fan since the firsf one came out 12 years ago and i can say that this one is as good. 👍👍,I love it as much as the first one if not even more!\\nIt\\'s amazing the actress was hilarious; I love it . I\\'m looking to see more of her . I hope there it\\'s a Borat 3 .\\nI highly recommend. I will keep my monthly subscription to amazon just for this one ; looove it .,This movie was awesome. Huge that the super serious Trumpers have such a hard time finding the humor in it all.,The film is a very quick watch that really does not take itself seriously at all. Some bits are downright hilarious but others are only mildly entertaining. The plot which holds together all the bits is not very strong; not that anyone expected it to be. It\\'s a decent film that may have been better in a YouTube format.,There\\'s a few really funny scenes; otherwise it was pretty boring. I understand it was probably hard to do since everyone knows who he is now; but there wasn\\'t any really shocking moments except the Daddy Daughter dance lol.,Same borat humor but whoever did the HDR edit of the movie did not watch it. 30% of scenes are to dark to see what\\'s going on. Reminded me for the last episode of game of thrones,I loved Borat and I even loved parts of this movie too. All the political satire; the jokes on women and jews; everything was great. But it felt a little like Saturated Borat because they added a character of his daughter. It was not a \\'Borat\\' movie. You can say that even in the first part there was a reporter with him. But still it was a \\'Borat\\' movie. In this movie; the girl has been given too much time on screen and that saturated the regular Borat a bit. It\\'s my opinion. If you think the same then like the review.Cheers.,When Sacha Baron Cohen puts on his mask; he removes everyone else\\'s. Often mistaken for mere racist caricatures; his stereotypical characters serve to confirm the biases of his unwitting documentary subjects (usually the voting American public and sometimes the very officials they\\'ve elected); effectively catfishing them into revealing even uglier sides of themselves.Unfortunately; his character of Borat is too well-known (and over-quoted) to make another pseudo-realist \"prank film\" without getting caught. That is; at least under the Borat Sagdiyev moniker (even as his latest film was produced pretty secretively). What if; oh I dunno... Borat himself was to put on disguises?As confirmed by 2018\\'s Who is America; Cohen does still know how to dupe voters; celebs; and public figures into unleashing their worst selves; and this extra-layered bit of trickery is no exception. Following the early screenings; Cohen\\'s latest prank was already making headlines; having caught cybersecurity advisor Rudy Giuliani in the act of doing something not-much-better than that which he himself has attempted to ruin the Biden family for.In the movie; Borat\\'s near-feral and supposedly underaged daughter; Tutar (Maria Bakalova); joins the Kazakhstani reporter on his second trek to the United States; meeting such figures as Mike Pence and the aforementioned Giuliani on the way. Thing is; since Giuliani is one of Cohen\\'s victims; he is not a part of the film\\'s fiction (the same way Borat and his daughter are) - thus; when taking Tutar\\'s in-universe age as fact and nevertheless \"enjoying\" her in his sleeping quarters; he isn\\'t acting. Even if you don\\'t share Cohen\\'s biases; Giuliani having this sort of kerfuffle is a gloriously poetic bit of comedy.I don\\'t know that this boner (pun intended) will delegitimize criticisms of the Biden family; but I feel a great swell of pity for Giuliani; mainly because his top defenders include Mike Cernovich; ever selective with when he chooses to call out pedophilia (jokes on Twitter is usually what does it; not the actual act). In a defense of Giuliani; Cernovich asked why we don\\'t investigate Cohen - who; in the same footage; also seemed to believe Bakalova was no more than 15 and still made it possible that Giuliani brought her to his bed (by writing it so that Tutar will do anything to become \"next Queen Melania\").First of all; the actress isn\\'t actually 15. Second of all; Cohen was in-character as Borat; who does have a 15-year-old daughter in the form of the character portrayed by said actress. The only party who conceivably believed that Tutar was a real-life minor is the politician who tried to f-ck her; i.e. the person currently being defended by \"righteous; free-thinking reporters\".Basically; Cohen continues to stand out among contemporary comics. Matt Zoller Seitz summarized the film\\'s mission as \"positioning its hero as a depraved; narcissistic fool whose flaws and excesses mirror his clueless targets\\' so closely that they don\\'t realize they\\'re being made fun of; even when Cohen stops just short of hauling out a sign that reads; \\'YOU ARE THE JOKE\\'.\" He also eloquently describes the film\\'s ultimate point on America: \"For all its posturing as The Greatest Nation on Earth; the United States circa 2020 has more in common with a retrograde foreign backwater than its government or people like to admit.\"Much of Cohen\\'s Borat shtick has always been about how; on top of pretending to affirm the beliefs of bigots; the bogeyman said bigots like to rail against isn\\'t that far removed from themselves (in terms of how they view gender roles or religion or whatever); which becomes especially obvious when they actually start BONDING with the Borat figure. Notice how I\\'ve gone this far without mentioning mankinis or goofy catchphrases (or the beautifully idiotic way in which Borat combats the Coronavirus). Just so the detractors (and certain fans) are clear that there\\'s more to this IP than they realize.,Waste of time! Not even funny. Loved the first movie. But this one was absolute trash.. just wanted some comedy with out the politics.,Borat 2006 was great; until it found out to be mostly scripted with a few real gags.Borat 2020 is undeniably mostly scripted. There is no ways Cohen would be able to get away with what he does without being sued.,I\\'m so glad we finally got a sequel; this is something everyone wanted but that couldn\\'t be done because everyone already knew about Borat at that point.This was the perfect movie that we needed during the pandemic and It\\'s a masterpiece,The film started slow and ended very slow and at the end could not make head nor tail out of it. The first part was a fantastic movie but this was a disappointment. Even the picturization is so dull and gloomy even in outdoor shots. Content is good but the story line and is awful.,If you like the first your going to watch it.. just taper your expectations because its nowhere as good. Mostly scripted and a lot less candid humor.,Here is a huge 10 from me;to the man with balls of steel. I didn\\'t expect anything;especially not to live up to the first movie. Yes there are some parts that are maybe dragged out or could be replaced with other pieces to be more funny and dynamic;but all in all the movie is brilliant. It is another type of Borat movie.\\nAs for the political views i might not exactly share them with Sacha as i do not live in the West;but since when should that stop appreciating genius comedy ?\\nSacha has done it again !,Although I may be a minority voice I feel this wasn\\'t a touch on the original film.\\nCohen has always been quite political in nature. Irrespective he has largely subverted his views and let the comedy speak for itself. With the exception of a handful of laughs I found it depressingly obvious where he was headed. For all those not old enough to have watched Da Ali G Show on Channel 4 in the UK it was a surprising mix of both highbrow and lowbrow comedy loaded into a tightly spoken paraphrase. He didn\\'t care who he made fun off it crossed all political and non political boundaries. Now unfortunately I think he is only happy to be politically incorrect when it validates his political correctness to left learning audiences. I\\'d still be happy to watch his next attempt; but please don\\'t dumb it down for your audience.,Possibly the least funny movie I\\'ve ever seen! Worse than Ishtar if anyone is old enough to remember that flop,A very disappointing movie all round...\\nMostly staged; everything note worthy covered in the trailer. It was always going to be hard to do a sequel and honestly they should have not gone through it.\\nCouple of of laughs throughout but generally not funny and predictable,Lied to her to take part in a \"Documentary\" and massively underpaid her.,Very demeaning for women. objectifying women. Some of the content is funny though.,This film has officially usurped my favorite comedy \\'Neighbors;\\' the Belushi one not the recent one.\\nSacha manages to spin several subs themes and spins them all to a perfect conclusion that shows the absurdity of each one.\\nThe performance by Maria is absolutely unbelievable and I wish I had a girl like her around when I was raising he*l in my younger days. She is ice cold and doesn\\'t miss a beat.\\nFew people give Sacha the respect he deserves....he is absolutely brilliant.\\nBTW. Wanna discover if you are a truly independent thinker or just one who\\'s desperate to belong to a side.....\\nI have the answer for you. IF YOU ENJOYED THIS MOVIE IRRESPECTIVE OF YOUR POLITICAL VIEWS; YOU ARE AN INDEPENDENT THINKER.\\nIF NOT; YOU ARE A MORON SEEKING TO BELONG TO a GROUP. Nothing more; nothing less!\\nThat\\'s true for both sides of the political spectrum.,Some genuinely funny moments which isnt easy as its a reheated formula. Some scenes were not so nice as cohen seemed to exploit innocent and nice people. The rudy scene in the hotel while news media blockbuster was a complete honey trap. Yes overall the guy is a sleaze bag. But constantly touching him on the knee and buttering him up seductively before inviting him into the bedroom for a drink. She pulled his shirt up unmiking him; leaving him needing him to tuck back in. No doubt he thought he was onto an sexual encounter but only because she led him strongly to feel that way. Why barge in; why not let the camera keep rolling and really catch him in an expose. Cohan always takes the easy option with easy targets. Its funny at times but not serious movie making. Candid camera on steroids. I almost felt sorry for guiliany and thats saying something considering his lack of character.,I like Sasha and his movies. I am not sure I enjoyed this one. It was mostly fake and I could see it. With previous movies; there was way more real content. I get it; everyone knows borat these days so it\\'s hard to find clueless people. It\\'s just 95% of the content was fake/staged. The joke lines were not bad;especially in the beginning;but by middle; there was very little.,The original Borat film for a masterpiece. Sacha Baron Cohen is; to me; the best comedian of his generation along with Dave Chappelle. The problem with this sequal was that it was very far between the hilarous moments. Yes; a lot of it was funny in the case that it could make you smile a little; but there was only like one or two scenes that made you burst out in laughter. In comparison; the first Borat film was completely hilarious all throughout. I had quite big expectations for this sequel; and when the closing credits came up I just sat there feeling oddly disappointed. Obviously a must watch for many reasons; but don\\'t expect a masterpiece; because it isn\\'t one.,Hilarious; raunchy and the humorous side of the absolute worst of humanity! Just as much of a classic as the original.,All I can say as it hits all the notes! I hope we get to see more of Sasha in the near future! Bring Back Ali G Baby!!,Underwhelming but funny... not as funny as the 1st borat but it\\'s great to see some political commentary I guess.. Still pretty funny and topical but doesn\\'t get anywhere close to the first borat.,It was funny at times but the surprise factor of Baron-Cohen being able to play a character which; back then in the first film; wasn\\'t recognised as being Baron-Cohen pranking people; was obviously gone in this film. It constantly made me think which scenes were real and which ones were staged? I honestly believe most of the scenes were scripted this time. I think the people involved weren\\'t actors; but most of the scenes must have been scripted. I mean you could basically just see it by the bad acting! Except probably for the public scenes during the \\'anti-covid\\' rally; the CPAC conference and the interview with Guiliani. But this just made the story a bit weaker in my opinion. On the other hand; the scenes where those American yanks were just basically making a fool out of themselves were entertaining nevertheless! 😏,Although I\\'d love to review this with rose-tinted glasses I\\'m not going to. I laughed about 25 times during this movie which isn\\'t terrible but it just isn\\'t up to par with the First Movie.\\nSome scenes were flat out disgusting. The Hall/Period Scene was This movie at it\\'s lowest point. It\\'s a 5 out of 10,Borat is the biggest POS I have ever watch. This isnt funny just a stupid film to help the millennias deal with life.,I guess people will do anything for money now a days.. 1st one was just plain dumb this one is even dumber. When he tried to dress up as Trump; he didn\\'t look anything like him and he didn\\'t even try to sound like him.,Watching this from Australia I\\'m glad everyone can finally see how inward looking America really is . United States ? Yer right ....Great movie ; very funny ; gotta love the Cinderella cartoon rip off lol,Funny. I enjoyed it. Can\\'t wait to watch it again.,I went in expecting this movie to be worse than the first one; becausw let\\'s face it that how usually films are; but it was by far worse than i ever thoight. There were some funny scenes; but i only laughed maybe three times. It all looks forced and honestly; it is the worst Cohen production i ever watched. It is not an age thing either; \"Who is America\" was made just one or two years ago and it was hilarious. This looks like it was written and filmed very fast just for the sake of filming it.Should you watch it? Honestly; don\\'t. If you are a major fan; especially then. Better go watch \"Who is America\".,Another excellent movie from Sacha Baron Cohen. As a father I loved Borat\\'s acting with his \"daughter\" Tutar; and have watched it 3 times.The rehearsed dancing; music; jokes; entertaining scenes and THAT usual shocking scene from Sacha will make you jump and get excited like you are watching a thriller.Great Success!,Sasha as Borat does it again. Less is more almost. Less meetings but more massive the shock and cringe and exposé he makes of the deep underbelly of good and bad in America and American politics. I surprised he didn\\'t get arrested with his \"daughter\". Imagine if Rudy Guliani sued them and the judge said ok \"play the tape\"🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣,Being a huge fan of Borat; I was anticipating for this film. Cliche jokes; (cell phone and facetime puns; in 2020? Really?); bad scripting; and an unimaginative plot; didn\\'t do the trick for me. Felt way too forced and way too much political. I understand he wanted to do an anti-Trump movie; and release it before the elections; but this is Borat. This is not the Cohen TV show. Borat is a figure that we enjoyed world wide and was the sarcasm of the capitilistic West and the former Soviet; looking for a modern identity; wannabe capitalistic but still Soviet East. He could have made an anti-Trump TV movie instead; and promote it as such; and yes; then; it would be funny and great. But for a Borat movie; an international release; it\\'s a NO.,There was some funny bits but if you\\'re not American or interested in American politics it\\'s a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one. The first one was about Borat and his crazy adventures; this one was about current American politics with Borat. Might have been funnier as a series rather than a movie.,It\\'s pretty clear that the character hasn\\'t been practiced and that it\\'s almost like he\\'s doing an impression of him own character. That what happens when you leave something like this for so long.There are a few funny bits but it\\'s pretty disappointing of your expecting the old Borat.,Feels a bit too fake; and nobody in the film even gets that upset. Da Ali G Show was amazing; because you could tell he was simply sitting in a room with REAL people and they had no idea they were a part of the joke.\\nI enjoyed the first Borat film; but this one just feels too unrealistic to me. It\\'s possible the bits were all with people who had no idea this was Sacha Baron Cohen; but i sincerely doubt it. The dialogue and things people say seem much more rehearsed than bits on Da Ali G Show.Sure; the social commentary is interesting; and I like that Cohen still doesn\\'t shy away from any topic. But the \"shock value\" in this film consists of a lot of gross/ridiculous scenes with him & his daughter; where the meat & potatoes of Borat should be his interactions with everyday people. Just my $.02 on a mostly forgettable movie.,This wasn\\'t bad but... After 14 years a lot of things have changed and the issue is in the first movie they could make more aggressive;racist;dark humour than they can do now. Film is still nice despite that. They had idea; they stick to it. Another con or issue I see in this movie is giving more attention to women. I loved first Borat movie because it made fun of women and now when they praise women they are losing main point and attention... In my opinion; they could\\'ve waited a little bit longer and create better script for this movie; because first movie was masterpiece and this only Meh which is really disappointing.,Mostly funny especially the political parts otherwise ok,Borat was a phenomenon. Now it has to be referred to as \"the first Borat\" because of this sub-par sequel. Everything is predictable and on the nose; and the unpredictable parts are just plain stupid. We all deserved better.,I loved the movie; wow I love Sasha\\'s movies; and this one was no different; I laughed a lot; the guy is great; speechless for this movie; everything I said will be little to praise; if you are thinking of watching it; do not waste time.Film seen on October 24; 2020.,Warning: Spoilers!I actually think this is the better film/movie. It relies less on toilet & vulgar humour to embarrass unsuspecting victims; and on more (in comparison!) subtle commentary on human behaviour and attitudes to deceive people into exposing their own views and reactions.The \\'moon blood dance\\' went wayyyy too far. Without being too frank; even a woman/girl from a poor country wouldn\\'t allow herself to deliberately leak through to the point of spoiling an expensive dress that would be extremely special for her. It just isn\\'t that messy unless you don\\'t use protection.\\nI know it\\'s for comedic effect; I just think it was more crass than funny and spoilt the tone of the film (even with all it\\'s anoos jokes).The rest was pretty clever though.The pro-life pastor being more interested in saving the \"baby\" than Borat seemingly admitting to sexual assault; child abuse & incest; the plastic surgeon nodding along to his description of the \\'jew nose\\' and happily telling Borat what he recommends doing to his daughter\\'s body whilst not directing any of the consultation to her until she asks if he\\'d \\'sex attack\\' her; the dress shop owner just laughing when he asks for a \\'no means yes\\' dress; his hosts openly admitting that they think that the Clintons drink children\\'s blood and that Democrats shouldn\\'t have rights; then later claiming that the Holocaust is a hoax (!); his song at the rally with the audience all happily singing back that various people should be injected with \\'Wuhan flu\\' (that 2s ago they sang was a hoax) or chopped up like Saudi\\'s; and the whole Rudi interview... all set up some very shocking; but funny & clever ways of exposing some of the extreme beliefs and behaviours towards certain people that permeate through society.Only the Instagram influencer is listed in the credits; and they mention that they explained in advance to the elderly holocaust survivors (that would have been rather cruel); so I can only assume that the others were being themselves on camera.The timing was just right for this sequel; with Covid & the US election in 10d. I\\'m not sure if they jumped on the opportunity to use Covid as a plot line; or it was just a coincidence that they were already filming; but it was a great way of showcasing some of the crazy things going on.Baron Cohen has a great talent for taking a silly character & a silly story and using them to create a clever narrative on the things he gets to observe.,I watched both movies in a row of two days; Yesterday I watched The first one;it was an AMAZING COMEDY MOVIE which talked about it\\'s targets too. But now The Second one wasn\\'t at least A Comedy ! I only liked to laugh at the first 20 mins and last 5 mins; The other parts was kind of Drama Or something like that. And also it wasn\\'t like that Document-Style the first movie had. The Second movie had Some targets and some messages which wanted to give to The audience but those messages is kinda \"Too Much Bold\" and hadn\\'t the cleverness of First Movie.\\nI liked it; But just For watch it only once. Of Course I won\\'t recommend anyone to watch it and I would suggest They Make Their Love With The 2006\\'s movie.\\nI was Hopeful for some lovely Things But I couldn\\'t find In Our Subsequent Moviefilm.High Five!,US politics is just crazy; so it\\'s the perfect anchor for satire. However simply bashing Trump and republicans and being politically one sided feels lazy and I feel like this movie could have been so much more if they\\'d explored the insanity on both sides of the US political divideInstead this feels kinda like \"here\\'s some laughs by the way vote Biden\",I came into this extremely excited; but it didn\\'t take long for me to realise that this film wasn\\'t going to live up to the original. I\\'d probably say there were 3 actually funny; non-scripted scenes that made me laugh and maybe 1/2 chuckle-worthy scenes. Whereas the original had me laughing and shocked the whole way through; this one had me sitting waiting for something funny to happen. I knew the originals greatness couldn\\'t be topped but this one really didn\\'t hit the mark. A decent comedy but don\\'t come expecting much if you\\'ve watched the original as it simply won\\'t compare.,I have been a SBC hardcore fan since 1997 and believe me when i say HARDCORE i mean it...........the first Borat was off the hook........but this one? eeeerm.............its an updated/same scripted version of the first one;exept the enemy is trump now;nearly same jokes........and the daughter? where do i start? talentless acting annoying accent and the whole vibe was that she never wanted to be in the movie..........i dunno i am split 50/50 i am glad to see another Borat...........but its outdated so to speak.........and btw why in gods name would they kill off Azamat??????????????? Ken Davitian stated in a recent interview he would star in any shape or form in Borat 2......but they killed him off? had it not been him SBC wont have won the golden globe,Timely sequel to the 2006 hit given that it has released on Amazon weeks before the US election. After serving a long prison sentence; Borat is sent on a mission to the US to give his daughter to Mike Pence thereby increasing Kazakhstan\\'s standing.Much the same as the original with plenty to enjoy; albeit the originality has passed; hence not the shocker the first one was. That said there are many wonderful swipes at Trump and his supporters incl the NRA; inherent racism; the belief in buzzwords and theatre rather than facts and the handling of COVID. Rudy Giuliani loses a lot of credibility here coming across as quite a creep (irrespective of who you vote for) it must be said - funny though.So ultimately quite a few laughs; some misfires but worth catching for the messages it sends. I think 2 is enough though.,I loved the first one. Did not feel the same. It was a propaganda flick which was unfortunate.Some funny scenes. Boards daughter stole the show.,A few decent laughs but the whole flick felt rushed and staged. I find it hard to believe anyone would be fooled by his characters now. It\\'s a shame because the first Borat movie might of been one of the greatest theater experiences ever. Never laughed so hard before; the whole audience was nuts. the actress who played his daughter was the real highlight in this.I Felt the Giuliani scene was interesting but not insanely funny. The period dance and the pro lifer scenes were the best. I general feel the exploitation of the kindness of the redneck dudes who took him in during the Covid lockdown weak.,IF YOUR LOOKING FOR RAW; TEAR DROPPING LAUGHTER FROM REAL REACTIONS TO BORATS MADNESS LIKE HE DELIVERED IN THE ORIGINAL; THEN YOU\\'LL BE AS DISAPPOINTED AS I WAS... IT\\'S NOT FUNNY WHEN THE TARGET IS IN ON IT... I\\'M SHOCKED THAT THIS COMIC GENIUS INSULTED THE INTELLIGENCE OF HIS FANS BY ALLOWING THIS TO BE SHOWN TO AUDIENCES.,Meh. Obviously scripted and timed for a \"certain event\". Marginally watchable; and that\\'s if you\\'ve had a few; with only a couple of funny moments. Sacha should be ashamed of this partisan sellout; all the more so; since as an englishman; he has no business interfering with any of it.,They tried really hard to do what they did best in the first part. They did not succeed.,I\\'m gonna keep watching to see it but 30 mins in and I\\'m like ah....idk if it\\'s worth it! I loved the first one but that was a moment in time.,Its still hard to see who is in on the joke and who isnt. but overall i had a few laughs. but again it swings back and forth between cringe and humor. with the new political landscape it brings some new ideas; but like the previous film; it will get dated very quick.5/10: ye ok,Sadly this film\\'s directing style is more reminiscent of Cohen\\'s later movie; The Dictator; than it is his earlier works of the original Borat prequel or Bruno. More focus feels given to the fictional being of our Kazakh characters than it does actual reality. At times it comes off too in-your-face with the scriptedness or blatant editing; so the film never gives a chance for reality and its genuine characters to breath with same earnest reactions as the original film.While the film starts and finishes with a heavy-handed partisanship; it does work surprisingly well for the script and in today\\'s political scene. Unfortunately like all topical pieces; that also means this will not age well and be much forgotten.Overall; expect to get some cheap laughs; but don\\'t expect the same original masterpiece.,I\\'m not sure where the positive reviews come from but this just has to be the dumbest movie ever.,Sooo disappointing. Watched it all to ensure I saw the twist and political message behind the movie. But for a movie labelled \"comedy\" it\\'s not funny. It\\'s crude teenage boy comedy that adults would cringe at. Disgusting beyond belief. Hardly made a sound watching this movie. No rolling on floor laughing moments. Any slightly good parts felt like déjà vu. Did not need a part II of this movie. If you want to see a euro comedy watch \"Eurovision song competition\". If you want to lose 2 hours of your life and learn nothing watch this.,The movie doesn\\'t have the great in the moment scenes that the first one had. Giving these ordinary people lines to read to advance the plot fall on it\\'s face. Also frames entire scenes around trying to get \"gotcha\" moments from people that don\\'t go anywhere or have a funny punchline. The daughter character is well acted and funny; but the movie definitely has an agenda behind it. The final 10 minutes are straight propaganda. The jokes about how backwards Kazakhstan is are hilarious; but the jabs at Americans are lazy and tired.,It\\'s not as funny as the first one but it\\'s still damn funny. Borat\\'s daughter is actually a scene stealer in this. I liked it. Sacha baron cohen is a comedic genius and he\\'s just as funny in this one. I really liked the chemistry between these two. I\\'d watch Borat 3 in a second.,I was so excited for the sequel to a movie I call one of my favorites of all time. However this sequel just fell really short. Its highs are very high but its lows are sooooo low. It seems extremely slow at times. As well as failing to meet the magic the first one had with the real world interactions. The ending is fantastic and makes me want another one but in the way the last 25 minutes are shot. Not the every minute before it. Funny? Yes. Boring? Also kind of yes.,Over and over again...beating that horse. We get it; Cohen doesn\\'t like conservatives. Some parts are funny. Target everyone! Only redeemer is the people poked at fully accept Borat for who he is. They invite him into their homes treat him with respect. Same old story though. Gets aggravating.,She was great. But making a joke about shootings in a time when they\\'re actively happening is just f\\'d. Honestly I started off laughing at a few things then it just got dark and gross and the jewish jokes made me wish I never watched it. Upsetting.,Hard to believe it\\'s been 14yrs and the Borat character is still just as recognizable today. In fact; it\\'sso recognizable that I\\'d argue it\\'s impossible to believe all the bs stories about people suing because they felt tricked.\\nThat being said; I just couldn\\'t get the laughs from this film that I got from the original. I admit I found the actress playing the daughter super cute and both the main characters were talented; but the film relied so heavily on the same old jokes that I was barely able to muster a chuckle. For me; the primary laughs came from how ridiculous some of our political views sound when spoken out loud. I\\'d imagine too many people across the world they sound as ridiculous as they came across on screen.\\nMaybe I\\'m just older or too analytical not but I couldn\\'t find the pranks as plausible as I did during the original.\\nWith nothing else to do; it\\'s a movie that passes the time but that\\'s mostly all it is.\\nI\\'d imagine anyone who liked Borat is going to watch this and everyone else will pass; I can\\'t imagine anyone being on the fence about this one...,Idk when u can ever say the second movie was better the the first one but this was the case sad to say I liked it but I didn\\'t think they took the best approach on politics like they liked to play out in the movie as they made some scenes real life events and some choreographed how is the audience supposed to know Wuts real and not real other then thinking the whole movie is real staged hidden cam events even though it\\'s not how are the audience supposed to know the difference this movie is misleading,I am normally a big fan of Sacha Baron Cohen; but he should be ashamed of himself for coming out with this dross. I am sure he will pretend it was a satire of patriarchy; but really it was just an excuse to demean women for cheap laughs.,Menstruation is not a joke. Please someone tell this to creator.\\nI regret to see this movie.,However; it was mildly entertaining. Too much reliance on subtitles; imo. Maria Bakalova (as Tutar) did an amazing job. I would recommend this to watch; but it isn\\'t going to win any awards.,Movie is hilarious except for 1 scene that is truly disgusting. Made me want to vomit. I had to close my eyes until it was over. Why do movie makers think they constantly have to push to film what is ugly or disgusting? Don\\'t confuse innovation with disgusting. There is nothing noteworthy about it.,Whilst simplistic in its message the very charm is how deliberate it is ....and well executed. Plus funny. Cringe worthy at times of course. Tutar stands out. Cohen is an extraordinary talent.,Very funny and many scenes to talk about with your friends. Do not believe the one-stars from those who were offended politically. If easily offended; you will be.,Some laughs but struggled to find the meaning of it all. The last film was more of a documentary.,Full of farcical prank jokes! And parodies of political incorrect jokes. After five years of Trump; this is not funny anymore. Political humor is just not my cup of tea.,I had some laughs; less than with original Borat; Bruno or Dictator. The problem was that he was going after predictable politically correct targets; not taking any risks like other comedians these days do.For example during the movie I could imagine just as funny situations and chants he could create if he was going after targets on the other end of the political spectrum.,Maria stifles laughs throughout; which is not good for an undercover actor. There\\'s a lot of deceptive cuts; etc. Borat doesn\\'t really offer anything fresh apart from a little woke moralizing on the side. There are some cute moments - the old jewish lady; and the qanon flatmates; but like the first film I didn\\'t find this particularly funny. I think I might actually prefer ali-g; something that was definitely coming from a more light hearted place than this film.,Comparing any sequel to an A+ original is going to be difficult. Having said that; I loved it. I thought he did a great job; especially with the fact that halfway through production; the virus hit and must have changed his original plan for the movie. When I think about it; the only thing I would have liked more is if there were less parts of him playing Borat being disguised as somebody else. Because; I get he\\'s an international celebrity; though the first film was 15 years ago; I think he could have gotten away with being Borat in public more. But it was hilarious with many wild moments. And his daughter; Titar; was outstanding; I would love a spin-off show or film just with her character. There is supposed to be much more great footage that wasn\\'t in the film; so I hope for an extended cut; or a release with deleted and extended scenes.,Doesn\\'t have the same charm as the first one. Focuses too heavily on current events and politics. It\\'s essentially a long SNL skit.,I really liked the first movie and I understand what Sacha Cohen is trying to do here. He had to top his first movie by making this one even more cruder and offensive than the first; and at that he succeeded. In the Borat style; the film is clever and some of his anecdotes are brilliant and hilarious (leading the viewer to think he is about to call Trump a bad President; for instance; only to then say Obama was the dictator and Trump was a Strongman Savior)With that said; there is also a very dark side of this film which essentially is that Sacha Cohen is making light and poking fun at human trafficking. The entire plot revolved around giving his daughter as a bride to a rich powerful man; and at several points Borat says he is \"selling her to her new owner\". She is made to live in a cage and at several points Borat says he has raped her simply because he wanted to and had gotten her pregnant as a result.Honestly; at least in my opinion; the film does go a little bit too far especially since the real Kazakhstan; as with many of the former Soviet republics; does have a very serious problem with human trafficking. I\\'m sure some people will say its only a movie; and they would be right; but what if there were scenes of the daughter getting beaten or raped by multiple men and forced into prostitution. That is the reality that this movie is essentially making fun of and it wouldn\\'t be so funny then.,Republicans think denis miller; john voight and every other conservative a**hole in hollywood are gods with their bs and hyperbolics lies; but when an actor they disagree with ideologically makes them look stupid they cry and say their opinion doesn\\'t matter... Almost like you\\'re all hypocrites? Facts don\\'t matter as long as I agree with the actor; and you wonder why you idiots elect ppl like trump? Good luck murica,This one didn\\'t have the same high brow; clever comedy as many of his other shows. Too partisan and not willing to go after everyone,A few laugh out loud moments; compared to the first nowhere near as good.\\nA lot of gags fall flat and felt forced.,Okay; taking away every political thing about this movie out of it; it just wasn\\'t as funny as the first with almost everything feeling staged. There was to much time spent between Borat and his daughter which isn\\'t what borat should be about it\\'s about him being funny and making people uncomfortable. I get it people recognized him and that can be difficult and with saying that then I\\'m sorry don\\'t make another movie then. This looked like a crash grab and or a political hit job to just say what everyone already hears in movies now which is trump sucks; vote Democrat. Okay we get it now can we get back to making movies funny and good again. I\\'m not political and sometimes I just don\\'t want to hear it all the time when I just wanna sit back and watch a movie. I\\'m saying that there where some funny moments like when he\\'s stuck inside with those two men other then that everything felt like the people where told there was a camera and didn\\'t make it authentic. It was just weird to see a sequel of a movie that was such a cultural phenomenon and then completely make it about politics I mean everything was and then also making it very staged. So; in conclusion it was okay some funny parts but overall if I was to tell you that another borat movie came out you would not expect this kinda movie at all. Also I\\'m kinda curious after this election how movies will be made if Biden wins because for the past five years we\\'ve heard and have seen the same jokes rehashed over and over so if he\\'s not there anymore what will movies look like? Just a thought.,I won\\'t go super fancy critic here as I\\'m not an English speaker.The first movie was impressive; couldn\\'t believe what I was watching. This time that shock won\\'t happen and the movie just feels as easy 2020 dem propaganda. While Borat will last classic and atemporal; this will be remembered as a short term polytical campaign.Ps: still 6 as the jokes still kinda politically incorrect at least.,First 15-20 minutes of the movie were promising; really good. Later; bad taste entered the scene..\\n-Toilet humor(unnecessary)\\nTo many scripted scenes and actors who made a deal with crew(cringes)Present; political topics; which will made this film unwatchable after some time.,OK but now the global tech giants want Biden in do no balance to who he humiliates. As a UK fan and no interest in us politics disappointing that there no objectivity. Still funny but we\\'ve seen it all before.,Anyone beyond the age of 3 who found anything remotely funny in this travesty or in the previous Borat movie is more intellectually shortchanged than the Trump Chumps. Hollywood has reached a new low. Yes; I loved the way it ridicules the fundamentalcase Klueless Kristian Kluxxers; & that is why it got a 2 rather than a 1 rating.,As a Sasha baron Cohen fan. I\\'m was disappointed. He always pushes the boundaries; but this was \"old hat\".\\nFrom Ali g to the spy. The guy is genius. This film though was tripe. Same jokes; just rehashed. You can\\'t play characters like Borat; ali g or bruno. More than once; the public won\\'t fall for it. Such ashame; because the first borat film was great. Hence 4/10 come on Sasha you can do better.,Largely compete for best movie for the oscars. A great great film about us; about our era.,It is amazing the lengths Sacha Baron Cohen and co star Maria Bakalova go to for the sake of comedy. They are relentless and I was in cracking up the whole time. The film also has heart and good intentions. Loved it.,Borat completely destroyed manusmriti and trump in one movie. All sanghis and republicans should watch - movie is for you. High five Borat,Obviously there was also a lot of bias before at the first film but everything was satirical and not really serious.... joking about our misunderstaing of diffrent coltures povery hate and so on\\nbut this feels like pure propoganda... extreme mislead and....\\nfunny still beacuse of how silly and idiotic it is...,It was ok. Pushed the edge as always just seemed forced. I think with all the politics we are already getting all day every day it probably would\\'ve been better to release next year after all this stuff is over.... hopefully,Cannot understand why the Kazakhstanian daughter speaks Bulgarian all the time (OK that the actress is Bulgarian - Maria Bakalova)..? I believe for some Bulgarians and Kazakhstanians who will watch it would be annoying; as it is for me; honestly.,Borat is back and after upsetting practically everyone following the events of the 2006 original film he attempts to make amends by offering a prize to a senior US political figure. Naturally; things don\\'t run smoothly and both Borat and his unwilling subject form an unlikely bond as the narrative progresses....I absolutely loved the original Borat and when I learned recently that a sequel was streaming on Amazon Prime I leapt at the chance and decided to watch it this evening. Whilst on the whole I enjoyed this sequel it\\'s definitely missing something when compared to the original...It starts out well and there are several moments in the first 20 minutes or so that are very reminiscent of the original Borat film; there\\'s the naivety and general sense of innocence with the character of Borat that we witnessed in the original film which were a big factor in making the original film work. However; in the sequel these aspects seem to be lost somewhere from 30 minutes onwards...Ok so the film is still fun and remains this way throughout; but the actual subtext to the story is extremely heavy-handed and somewhat unnecessary; somebody within the cast or production team is clearly heavily right-wing/republican and I did find that the serious political stance did take away from the film. This is offset at times by Borat and the republicans downplaying the virus (which does afford the film with some of its funnier moments); but what made the original film work so well is that you genuinely felt that you were watching an idiot go to America; make a fool of himself but with subtle winks to the camera.In this sequel the plot gets in the way far too much and the heavy-handed approach employed arguably takes away more than it adds (it\\'s shamelessly right-wing and pro-Trump which for me regardless of your political allegiance) makes the film too self-aware and makes it less funny. Thankfully the film does get back on track from time to time (the idea that Borat has inadvertently injected himself with the virus and spread it around the world is where the film is strong and had the film focussed on this I think it would have been better - essentially seeing an idiot inadvertently creating a global pandemic)Still Sacha Baron Cohen is as brilliant as he always is and newcomer Maria Bakalova is also excellent (and her makeover transformation is incredible). Whilst the final scenes in the film were hilarious I found the heavy-handed politics a little too much at times. It almost felt like I was watching a lengthy pro-Republican/Anti-democratic broadcast (and the sheer number of Trump\\'s cabinet that appeared in the film merely re-inforces this point making me think he either had a hand in bankrolling the film or somebody in the production crew was a big Republican).All that being said; this sequel to Borat made me laugh (a lot) and the ridiculous hyperbole surrounding the virus also resonated with me (I agree that it\\'s all overhyped). This sequel is still good; but second time around things feel a little too serious and self-aware which tarnish the overall quality of this sequel.,The original Borat was almost certainly the funniest thing Sacha Baron Cohen did. This film retreads similar ground in way that is quite difficult to distinguish from the original but it just doesn\\'t have the same vibe.Cohen is no different as Borat but the appendage of a clear political agenda to this film simply changes the character of the movie. Right wing Americans; Trump supporters; po-faced Christians etc just seem like not so much easy targets but incredibly predictable ones. The whole movie; framed around attempts to give Borat\\'s daughter away as some kind of sex gift; first to Pence and then Giuliani makes this film a piece of not remotely subtle political propaganda. In fact I almost hesitate to use the term because the kind of propaganda we encounter these days tries to disguise it\\'s purpose. Borat 2 at least has the decency not to do that. Sacha Baron clearly has very real political / ethical concerns about the illiberal nature of the Trump led Republican party & this film is simply about trying to damage the enemy.I can respect that I guess; but it makes it hard to take it as comedy in any kind of pure sense; which is something which really alters the movie; for however much Sacha Baron Cohen may remain the same very funny guy; he has lost his capacity to portray Borat as genuinely innocent.We experience this as a greater distance from the character; & the lack of something which was so important in the original film - the sense that at any moment Borat might do something truly shocking but innocent; so outrageous that it is cringeworthy. The problem here is though the shocking language & scatology come thick & fast they don\\'t have the same power to make us titter.The second main reason this is so is one the film addresses fairly early on: we know & Borat knows that most people already know all about him; that he\\'s famous & the possibility of milking comedy out of people caught completely off their guard has largely vanished. What this means in practice is that while we suspect that a lot of the film is basically scripted & performed by paid actors pretending to not know what is going on; where we suspect Borat might actually have caught someone unawares; we are still not sure it is a \\'real\\' encounter. It really isn\\'t Cohen\\'s fault that that is the case. He & the film-makers do their best to work around this but ultimately it is a huge weight round the film; even where the script is sound & the jokes are fairly objectively funny.In fact the only clearly unscripted events in the film are the gate-crashing of a Republican party convention where Pence is the guest speaker - the look on Pence\\'s face is priceless - a mixture of sadness & anger - & the interview with Rudy Giuliani. Rudy clearly does get suckered a little bit by Tutar; Borat\\'s much abused daughter; become journalist. It doesn\\'t look like anything would have happened but Giuliani is clearly charmed & flattered by the over-awed attention of the pretty young blonde woman with a confidence problem; who needs defending from her overbearing camerman (father). In fact it\\'s rather disconcerting how successfully they play Giuiliani in this way.There are some other funny bits. The beginning is quite funny. The absurdity doubling down on the calumies against Khazakstan as a nation are quite funny as is the idea that Khazakstanis are offended by holocaust-deniers because they are proud of their role in causing the holocaust (I\\'m fairly sure this is completely unfair to Khazakstan but who knows).But the jokes by and large are few & far between & mostly what we get - far more than in the original - is a story about Borat\\'s mission (to gift his daughter to Pence/Giuiliani) & the evolution of his relationship to his daughter.It\\'s here that something quite odd happens. While Borat seems slightly lame & stale; the daughter Tutar is actually really good. She has a genuine feel for the piss-take aspect of the Borat format; & seems a complete natural in the role; playing the almost savage caged downtrodden female (Borat\\'s Khazakstan seems to have doubled down on \"evil patriarchy\" since the last movie) with relish & really getting into the - probably best scene in the movie - the joint dance at the debutante scene. I said earlier that we were never quite sure whether the people getting sent up or outraged were real or actors - well I\\'m fairly sure the society figures & debutantes were real - the look of shock & disgust was almost certainly geniune & the same probably is true for the christian ladies who Tutar speaks out to later on.This aside the film dragged alot; & I never cared much about what happened. Sacha Baron Cohen is enormously talented; but he\\'s not quite as sympathetic as he used to be. Overall I preferred his Grimsby with Mark Strong over this by far.,In two weeks; half of the movie\\'s content becomes irrelevant. That said; it had its heartfelt moments in the synagogue and with the Patriot guys taking him in. The actress playing his daughter is a force to be reckoned with; under SBC\\'s wing she can really go far in the world of cinematic comedy...,186 out of 286 found this helpful,152 out of 235 found
